            “The beauty of ‘Thoth’ is that you never have the faintest idea what
            will happen next. This is the glory of romance, to keep up the reader’s
            curiosity from page to page.... But what could hardly be bettered is
            the veiled yet awful picture of the women, the mothers of the ruling
            race in this wonderful city.... The central and vivifying idea is, to
            us, absolutely novel.”&mdash;<cite>Saturday Review</cite>.

            forgotten.”&mdash;<cite>Graphic</cite>.
        </p>

        <p>
            “‘Thoth’ is a weird and mysterious romance, manifesting
            unusual literary skill, and displaying no small amount of
            imagination.”&mdash;<cite>Academy</cite>.

        <p>
            “An excellent romance, strongly imagined, and worked out with

        <h2>PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION.</h2>
    </div>

    <p>
        I gladly avail myself of this occasion to thank my critics for the
        very friendly reception they have accorded to a book which was issued,
        in the fullest meaning of the term, anonymously&mdash;that is to say, even
        without the knowledge of a single personal friend. At the same time, I
        wish to make an explanation which is partly of the nature of a protest.
    </p>

    <p>
        <i lang="la">Post hoc ergo propter hoc</i> may not always be a fallacy, but it was
        certainly a mistake on the part of several reviewers of ‘Thoth’ to
        translate it in their haste, “after ‘She,’ therefore on account of
        ‘She.’” For, as a matter of fact, ‘Thoth’ was designed and in part
        composed more than twelve years ago. In its present form, however, it
        has been entirely rewritten. It may interest some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">vi</span> of my critics to
        know the original intention and scheme, and the reasons why I delayed
        the publication even longer than the classical ninth year.
    </p>

    <p>
        The original idea was philosophical. I wished to illustrate the power
        of will and intellect working through generations with a definite
        design, and to show that this power might be used for the most
        repulsive object. The object I chose for my purpose was the destruction
        of the whole human race by means of pestilences, with the intention of
        replacing it with a race of men who had for generations been trained
        in the exercise of the highest intelligence. The new rule was to be
        a tyranny of intellect. The original designer of this scheme was
        supposed to be an Egyptian, who had discovered a method of suspending
        animation. His attempt to introduce the government of intellect amongst
        existing races had failed, and he determined to destroy them, even if
        it took thousands of years to prepare the means. The defeat of the
        scheme in the original plan was due to the friendship of the latest
        Thoth for Philetos. Philetos was, in marked contrast to these haters
        of men, a man whom every one loved, and who was the <i lang="fr">beau ideal</i> of a
        philanthropist. Thus the victory over hate in the original plan was
        gained by friendship.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">vii</span> The reigning Thoth introduced the plague at
        Athens, and his life was saved by Philetos. Afterwards Thoth attempted
        on three occasions to kill his friend, fearing the power of his
        friendship. The climax was reached in a scene in which the ancestral
        Thoth and his descendants were aroused, and the fate of the world was
        to depend on the decision of the ancient ruler.
    </p>

    <p>
        After writing a considerable part of ‘Thoth’ on this plan, I became
        dissatisfied for several reasons. In the first place, friendship alone,
        though in the ancient world one of the strongest passions, did not
        seem as I worked it out strong enough for my purpose. I had introduced
        also, in the last scene, a supernatural element of a purely imaginary
        kind, and I heartily disliked the <i lang="la">deus ex machinâ</i> even when of my own
        making. I also considered the style inflated and the characters far too
        abstract. The original idea, however, seemed worth developing; and when
        I took it up again after an interval of ten years, I substituted Daphne
        and love for Philetos and friendship, and put more of the elements
        of common humanity into the characters. I discarded the supernatural
        altogether, for however wonderful Thoth’s powers are, there is nothing
        beyond<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">viii</span> the possibility of modern science. Even the destruction of the
        city in the end is due to the want of a guiding mind.
    </p>

    <p>
        I have perhaps said enough to clear myself from the charge, never very
        hardly pressed, of conscious or unconscious imitation; but as it may
        interest some of my readers, I print in an appendix the last chapter as
        it originally stood.

        Nothing is more difficult than to separate the true from the false
        in a narrative in which it is necessary for the most part to rely on
        the testimony of one person only, and that person a woman whose mind
        had been shaken by extraordinary perils and vicissitudes. A task so
        laborious I shall not attempt, but shall simply set forth in order what
        Daphne, the daughter of Phi<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>letos, told me in fragments at various
        times, although I confess that some things seem in their nature
        impossible.
    </p>

    <p>
        This much, however, I will say for the benefit of posterity, and
        that it may not be imagined this writing is from beginning to end
        the figment of a poet’s fancy: Daphne was, without question, by far
        the most beautiful woman of her time, and excited a most violent and
        extreme passion in some of the wisest and most celebrated Athenians,
        before the events occurred which I am about to record. And I do not
        think it at all incredible that a man, driven by the madness of his
        love for her, should be induced to sacrifice everything he held most
        dear. Nor do I think it wonderful, considering the haughty ambition of
        many of no great worth or power, that a man who had a marvellous genius
        in making discoveries of the hidden nature of things, should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span> try to
        emulate the might of far-darting Apollo, who in his anger slays people
        in multitudes by the shafts of his plagues and pestilences. And if any
        one should think the conduct of this Egyptian and his ancestors, as
        manifested in their deeds, altogether contrary to human nature (as if
        one should say that doves chased hawks, or any other creature acted
        in a way quite different from its kind), I would not only remind him
        of the horrible and perverse sins even of Greeks in former times, but
        would also ask him to remember that for ages the Egyptians had been
        soured by a gloomy and cruel superstition.
    </p>

    <p>
        Then, again, as to all the matters which are said to have occurred in
        Athens, I have made the most careful inquiries, and, even in the most
        minute particulars, I find that the testimony of Daphne is confirmed.
    </p>

    <p>
        But to him who will be admonished, this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span> narrative, whether true or
        false, certainly declares that no human skill or strength of purpose
        can altogether conquer nature and chance, and may thus serve, like
        the tragedies of our poets, as a notable warning against pride and
        presumption.

            <small>THE PLAGUE AND THE MERCHANTS.</small>
        </h2>
    </div>

    <p>
        In the time of Pericles, as every one knows, Athens attained her
        greatest glory. Magnificent buildings were erected, and in them were
        placed statues and other ornaments of most exquisite workmanship.
        Whilst the work was in progress, great encouragement was given to
        foreign merchants, who brought materials of various kinds, and
        especially ivory and metals. The laws against strangers were in a great
        measure relaxed, and they were enabled to prosecute their business with
        as much freedom as the citizens themselves. Even after the out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>break
        of the Peloponnesian war, and when fear of spies and treachery was
        natural, there was still a great concourse of foreign merchants in the
        port and the city.
    </p>

    <p>
        But an event occurred which soon put to flight all strangers, and made
        Athens an object of the utmost dread. This was the great plague, of
        which Thucydides, the son of Oloros, has given a memorable account in
        his history.
    </p>

    <p>
        A most remarkable incident, however, which is the key-stone of this
        narrative, he has omitted to notice, probably because, being incredible
        in its nature, he ascribed it to the invention of those whose minds
        had been affected by the horrors of the scene, and considered it to be
        unworthy of the dignity of his style and his careful adherence to truth.
    </p>

    <hr class="tb" />

    <p>
        A few days before the outbreak of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span> plague, a company of merchants,
        about a score in number, arrived at Athens. They gave out that their
        native land was Egypt, but they had been trading with many Grecian
        cities at peace with Athens. They seemed to be extremely wealthy, and
        their merchandise consisted mainly of ivory and gems. They had also
        abundance of gold and silver. They acted as if they did not speak or
        understand the Greek tongue, and always transacted their affairs by
        means of interpreters. They appeared to be very careless or ignorant in
        their bargains, often selling their wares for a much less price than,
        with a little trouble and inquiry, they might have obtained.
    </p>

    <p>
        They made no purchases themselves, with one exception, and in this
        particular they were most fastidious and difficult to please. They
        showed the greatest anxiety to buy young female slaves, and they
        exer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>cised the greatest care in the selection. They not only demanded
        beauty and health, but inquired carefully into their education and
        abilities. It was generally complained that it was impossible to
        satisfy the demands of the merchants, as they appeared to apply tests
        which neither the women nor their owners could understand.
    </p>

    <hr class="tb" />

    <p>
        As soon as the plague appeared, which happened first of all in the
        port, all foreigners, with the exception of these Egyptians, fled away
        in their ships. They, however, in spite of the dissatisfaction they
        expressed with the slaves offered for sale, not only lingered on, but
        appeared to be quite regardless of the dangers of infection.
    </p>

    <p>
        Yet, in truth, both the disease and the circumstances of the
        plague-stricken city were such as to shake the courage of the bravest.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
        For, as the historian narrates, suddenly, without any apparent cause
        preceding, people who seemed in perfect health were seized with an
        extreme ache in their heads, and redness and inflammation of the eyes;
        then inwardly their throats and tongues grew presently bloody, and
        their breath became noisome and unsavoury. Thereupon followed sneezing
        and hoarseness, and, not long after, the pain, together with a mighty
        cough, came down into the breast. As the disease spread, most dreadful
        weakness and, in most cases, strong convulsions ensued. The bodies of
        the afflicted outwardly to the touch were not very hot, but inwardly
        they so burned as not to endure the lightest clothes or linen garment,
        and they would fain have cast themselves into the cold water. Their
        thirst was insatiable, and those who were not looked after ran to the
        wells; but whether they drank much or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span> little, they got neither ease
        nor power of sleep. Many suffered for seven or nine days, and then died
        of the inner burning, while yet their strength seemed undiminished;
        others survived the torment, and then died of weakness. Some escaped
        with the loss of their eyes or the extremities of the limbs, and others
        were so much stricken in mind that they remembered neither themselves
        nor their acquaintances. And the sickness, and the cruelty wherewith
        it handled each one, far surmounted all expression in words&mdash;it was so
        grievous and terrible.
    </p>

    <p>
        But the greatest misery of all was the dejection of mind in such
        as found themselves beginning to be sick, for they grew presently
        desperate, and gave themselves over without making any resistance. Many
        died like sheep affected by mutual visitation; and some, forsaken and
        forlorn, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span> want of such as should take care of them.
    </p>

    <p>
        The mortality was greatly increased by the crowds of country people
        who, on account of the war, had come into the city with their goods
        and chattels, and having no homes, they lived in stifling booths and
        in tents. Dying men lay tumbling one upon another in the streets, and
        about every spring and conduit. The temples, also, were full of dead,
        for, oppressed with the violence of the calamity, and not knowing what
        to do, men grew careless even of holy things. The laws which they
        formerly used touching funerals were all broken. When one had made a
        funeral pile, another getting before him would throw in his dead and
        give it fire. And when one was burning, another would come, and having
        cast therein him whom he carried, go his way again. Yet up to that time
        no feeling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span> amongst the Athenians was more profound than their respect
        for the dead.
    </p>

    <p>
        The city was filled with wailing, horror, and loathsomeness, but in the
        midst of despair there were frantic outbursts of outrageous pleasures.
        Licentiousness was unbridled, and men grasped at wild delights as if
        they held their lives but by the day. The rich died, and the poor, who
        had never dreamed of riches, slipped into their places, and, thinking
        they had not a moment to lose, made their only aim the speedy fruition
        of their goods. Neither the fear of the gods nor the laws of men awed
        any man. For it seemed all one, to worship or not to worship, seeing
        that all alike perished, and no one expected his life would last till
        he received punishment of his crimes by human judgment. Many thought
        that the whole city would be destroyed, and hastened to enjoy some
        little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span> part of their lives. Women left their apartments, and, without
        friends or guardians, rushed to the temples or tried to flee from
        the pestilence beyond the city bounds. For all discipline was broken
        through, and all did what seemed good to them.
    </p>

    <hr class="tb" />

    <p>
        In spite of these dreadful scenes, the Egyptians showed no signs of
        haste or alarm, and seemed to regard the terror-stricken people with
        mingled curiosity and contempt. At first this conduct was ascribed to
        the gloomy nature of their religion, and to the fact that in their
        own cities the plague was said to be never altogether stifled. But
        gradually a rumour spread that they had in their possession some drug
        or charm by which they made themselves proof against the pestilence.
    </p>

    <p>
        In a short time they were surrounded by a tumultuous throng of men
        and women.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span> A deafening outcry arose of threats and entreaties. Some
        tried to embrace the knees of the merchants, and offered them masses
        of gold and precious stones; others shrieked like madmen, “Give us
        life,&mdash;save us!” Some, on the other hand, tried to terrify them with
        brandished weapons; whilst others, hoping more from prayers, threatened
        the threateners, and assumed the part of defenders of the strangers,
        appealing to Zeus, the god of hospitality.
    </p>

    <p>
        As the tumult grew, and the pressure of the crowd increased, the
        merchants, speaking in an unknown tongue, seemed to address one
        who appeared to be their leader, in terms of remonstrance and
        expostulation, mingled, however, with respect and submission. No
        interpreter could be found, so that no one could understand what was
        said except vaguely from the looks and gestures of the speakers.
    </p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span></p>

    <p>
        Suddenly, the leader made signs as if asking for silence and attention,
        and a thrill of astonishment passed through the crowd as he began to
        speak in a language which many of the people could, with a little
        difficulty, understand. It seemed an ancient dialect of Greek, in most
        respects like that used by Homer in his poems.
    </p>

    <p>
        “Men of Athens,” he said, “ye wonder that we seem unmoved in the
        midst of this dreadful plague, and ye think that we have some charm or
        drug wherewith we defend ourselves from the infection. But we indeed
        are careless, because death by the pestilence seems to us no worse
        than the doom with which we are threatened if we escape. We come from
        a country beyond Egypt, and are the descendants of a remnant of Greeks
        who for many generations have been held in honourable captivity by the
        powerful princes of the land. We have <span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>preserved our own customs, and as
        ye see, our own language, and we have served as priests to our masters.
        And often the daughters of our race have been chosen as queens, and
        till a little time ago everything went well with us. Then certain
        Greeks appeared, who aroused the envy of our king and his princes
        by telling of the glories of Athens, and praising, most of all, the
        beauty and the wit of the Athenian women, and they have sent us, not
        only to bring back a faithful report of the grandeur of your city, but
        they have ordered us to bring a number of your most beautiful and best
        educated maidens, to become wives of the king and his nobles. In the
        meantime they hold those Greeks in captivity, and also our wives and
        children, and they have threatened us and them with dreadful punishment
        if we do not bring back the maidens; and we <span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>thought at first to
        purchase slaves, but we fear detection, for how can slaves make fitting
        queens? But now the plague which has struck down your people seems to
        offer us some hope of safety. For, perhaps, some of your maidens, being
        without protectors in this calamity, will themselves be willing to go
        with us, or their guardians, fearing the worst, will send them. And
        in token of our good faith, we have brought large stores of precious
        things to leave with you, and we will bind ourselves with great oaths
        that the maidens shall be dealt with in the most honourable manner. And
        as regards this pestilence, we can indeed offer you no certain cure,
        but we would earnestly warn you, knowing something of the matter by sad
        experience, that your only hope of safety is in avoiding crowds, and
        keeping as much apart as possible. But see for yourselves the truth of
        my words.”
    </p>

    <p>
        <span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
        And as he spoke thus, several persons in the throng were suddenly
        taken with the plague, and terror seized on the rest, and they broke
        up and fled. Many of the maidens, however, remained, believing through
        the extremity of their fear that it was best for them to go with the
        Egyptians.
    </p>

    <p>
        And although it would be easy for any one sitting quietly at home in
        the enjoyment of calm prosperity to consider the tale which they told
        as unworthy of credence, it was a very different matter under the
        actual circumstances of the case. And, as will appear in the sequel,
        there was as much truth as falsehood in the promises, and the falsehood
        was chiefly of that kind which consists in the suppression of truth.
        One thing at least was certain, and was calculated to impress the
        senses. They had undoubtedly a large amount of trea<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>sure, of which they
        seemed quite careless. Besides this, it was known that they had made
        endeavours to purchase female slaves for their purpose. But, above
        everything else, the minds even of men of courage and philosophers had
        been shaken in the terror, and it was natural for young maidens to
        believe in anything which seemed to promise them a chance of safety
        from a horrible death.
    </p>

    <p>
        In a short time more than thirty of the fairest young women of Athens
        had promised to go on board the Egyptian vessel; and to these, that no
        doubt might shake them at the last, the leader told a thing still more
        wonderful. He said, with an appearance of the greatest secrecy, that
        they had a charm by which a small number could be protected against the
        plague, and that they had failed to mention this because its virtue
        would cease if applied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span> beyond this small number. Then he painted, in
        the most glowing language, the delights and pleasures which would be
        their lot in the distant land. He also proceeded to terrify those whom
        he was unwilling to take, and the maidens he had chosen began to fear
        now that others might take their place, and promised to do all he bade
        them.
    </p>


    <div class="chapter">

            <small>DAPHNE.</small>
        </h2>
    </div>

    <p>
        Yet, in spite of the promises which the Egyptian made, and the
        unspeakable terror of the maidens on account of the plague, it is
        doubtful if they would have consented to go at the last had it not been
        for Daphne.
    </p>

    <p>
        For when the men had fled and most of the maidens, and only those
        remained whom the stranger had chosen, and to whom he was telling
        flattering tales in order to take away their dread, Daphne suddenly
        appeared, having heard of what had taken place.
    </p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span></p>

    <p>
        It chanced that all her family had been taken by the plague, and she
        was left quite alone,&mdash;for, as was well known, she was a native of
        Miletus. She had been brought by her parents to Athens as a young girl,
        owing to some political troubles, and was at this time less than twenty
        years old; and to make this narrative clear to those of a later time
        who may chance to read it, something must be said of the character of
        Daphne before these adventures began.
    </p>

    <hr class="tb" />

    <p>
        First of all, she was strong of will, and rather ruled than obeyed her
        parents; and she not only obstinately refused an honourable marriage,
        but spoke bitterly of the small esteem and respect in which the
        Athenians held their lawful wives; and she upheld as a model Aspasia,
        her compatriot, the friend of Pericles, and in all but name his
        honoured wife. For, whilst<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span> the lawful wives of the noblest Athenians
        were cooped up like children in their own apartments, Aspasia enjoyed
        perfect freedom, and was entertained of the brightest wits and the
        wisest and bravest of Athens; and she was knit to Pericles with ties of
        most ardent affection, far stronger than any bonds fastened by a forced
        contract, and she was honoured and treated as were the consorts of
        noble Greeks in olden times, and not regarded merely as a nurse for her
        husband’s children.
    </p>

    <p>
        And Daphne had determined, in like manner, to enter into no forced
        marriage, but to form a fitting connection with some man whom she loved
        and honoured, if chance so willed it, in marriage, but if not, even
        as Aspasia with Pericles. And what may perhaps to some seem strange,
        whilst she had constantly asserted for herself the truest freedom,
        she had preserved also the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span> strictest virtue. Many Athenian youths
        had loved her, and some men of good standing, but none had touched
        her fancy. Like Aspasia, she had been carefully trained in poetry,
        rhetoric, and music, and she could converse with much acuteness and in
        a pleasing manner.
    </p>

    <p>
        Now, when the plague had carried off her natural protectors and
        desolated the city, Daphne not only despaired in her heart of carrying
        out her idea in practice, but was afraid for her life, and at the least
        dreaded that her beauty would be marred or the sharpness of her mind
        blunted.
    </p>

    <p>
        And when she was thus cast down in spirit, a maiden of her acquaintance
        came running, and told her all the Egyptian had promised, saying that
        they were themselves of Grecian stock, and spoke the language of the
        old heroes.
    </p>

    <p>
        And Daphne, although she thought the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span> report an idle tale or a snare,
        still, seeing that it offered some chance of safety, whilst in the city
        there seemed none, agreed to hear what the stranger had to say.
    </p>

    <p>
        She found the maidens in a group apart, weeping and terrified, and
        taking counsel together; but the Egyptians were talking to one another
        in an unknown tongue, and laughing, as it were, over a good jest. To
        Daphne, however, there seemed to be more bitterness than mirth in their
        laughter, and she swiftly determined not to go, and to dissuade the
        others also. But suddenly the leader turned his eyes full upon her, and
        she felt compelled, as if by some superior power, to scan his features
        closely, and to try to pierce his thoughts.
    </p>

    <p>
        He was of ordinary stature, and evidently in the full vigour of
        manhood. His frame was strong, and his appearance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span> denoted the
        perfection of health; but he did not appear to be trained in athletic
        exercises in the Greek manner, and his whole bearing was that of a man
        accustomed to work more with the mind than the body. His forehead was,
        both in height and breadth, much more massive than was customary with
        the Athenians. His hair, which was cut very short, and his eyebrows,
        were perfectly black. He wore no beard, and the fineness of his skin,
        although darker than that of even Asiatics, seemed almost boyish. His
        nose and mouth were of the pure Greek type, and the setting of his
        lips and chin denoted great determination. His eyes, however, formed
        by far the most striking feature of his person. They were deeply
        seated under overhanging brows, but their large fulness and intense
        blackness made them at once seize the attention of the beholder. Even
        in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span> momentary repose they displayed a wonderful and mysterious depth of
        intelligence, but the rapid restless motion with which they generally
        absorbed every detail in the range of sight, revealed a marvellous
        power of observation and quickness of decision. Their glances seemed to
        penetrate the inmost recesses of the mind; and the Greek maiden knew
        at once that she had never seen such power in any countenance, and she
        felt at first sight the influence of a mighty will.
    </p>

    <p>Daphne was in most respects in striking contrast to the Egyptian leader.</p>

    <p>
        She was more than his equal in the exquisite proportions of her limbs,
        and she was in the very spring-time of youthful beauty. But her
        forehead, though broad, was low, and showed no trace of the oppression
        of thought. Her eyes were like those of the goddesses in Homer,
        whom,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span> confident in the truth of nature, he boldly praised as being
        ox-eyed. They seemed as if formed for the display of all the tenderness
        and longing of the highest human love, but sensuous and passionate
        they were not, and everything in Daphne’s appearance betokened a
        well-balanced and restful mind.
    </p>

    <p>
        Woman she was in perfection, of the purest Greek race, with the soft
        outlines of a beauty moulded by feeling, with lips ready to respond
        to affection or to reject scorn with passionate impulse, with a hand
        soft for caresses, or when knit with anger, strong as the Amazon’s in
        battle. Power her face showed in abundance, but it was the power of
        the varying instinct that has reason for its instrument, and utterly
        unlike that of the Egyptian, in which a glance seemed to show that
        every passion was under the control of an iron<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span> will, and guided by
        reason only. The woman moved with easy grace, as if every gesture was a
        pleasure, whilst every movement of the man betokened restless, untiring
        energy.
    </p>

    <hr class="tb" />

    <p>
        When the Egyptian leader saw Daphne with the maidens who had already
        agreed to make the venture, he first of all seemed astonished at her
        radiant beauty and her composure of manner, and then said:&mdash;
    </p>

    <p>
        “We had completed the number of those whom we would take, but come thou
        too if thou wilt, for thou art a goddess-queen amongst the others.”
    </p>

    <p>
        But she answered&mdash;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>“It seems as if ye wished to take advantage of our
        terror and steal us away for slaves, for your tale is difficult to
        believe. Ye boast yourselves to be Greeks, but many tribes of Grecians
        have I seen, and none with features and hair like yours; and ye speak
        not Greek to one another, and the language thou thyself speakest seems
        learned from the books of old poets, and not thy mother’s tongue.”
    </p>

    <p>
        Then the leader replied&mdash;“These men are my servants, and through
        dwelling long among strangers our appearance has changed.”
    </p>

    <p>
        And Daphne had from the first been constrained to admit that his
        countenance seemed much more noble and kingly than the rest; but she
        said, “Give me some sign that these are thy servants. Why does that
        man,” pointing to one of them, “sneer at me and laugh so immoderately?”
    </p>

    <p>Then the leader said, “Here is a sign for thee.”</p>

    <p>
        And going up to the man, he struck him full in the face, and the blood
        started from his lips, and the man fell as one dead, yet none of his
        companions said a word.
    </p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span></p>

    <p>
        Then Daphne believed in his authority, but she was alarmed by his
        violence and turned to go. But he said to her&mdash;
    </p>

    <p>
        “Wilt thou indeed go back to a loathsome death when life and honour
        and riches are open to thee? Wouldst thou through silly fear become
        like him?” and he pointed to a man at a little distance writhing in the
        agony of the plague. “I can save thee if thou wilt. See, the plague has
        no terror for me.”
    </p>

    <p>
        Then he went up to the sick man and took him by the hand, and looked
        steadfastly in his face and said, “Thou art fortunate&mdash;thou wilt not
        die of this disease.”
    </p>

    <p>
        And another plague-stricken wretch near him begged with parched lips
        for water, but he said, “Too late!” and turned to Daphne.
    </p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span></p>

    <p>
        “Take care it is not too late for thee! We have already more than
        enough who are willing to go. Still it vexes me to leave the loveliest
        to black death, and to save others. What more dost thou desire to know
        or to make me promise?” and he seemed to speak and look in a more
        kindly manner than before. And suddenly through Daphne’s mind there
        flashed the words of the poet, “Rather would I live on earth as the
        hireling of another with a landless man who had no great livelihood,
        than bear sway among all the dead that be departed.” Then she said,
        “Promise me one thing. Swear to me by thy strongest oath, and I will
        go. Swear to me if, when I reach thy country, I like it not, thou wilt
        send me back unharmed either to Athens or to some Greek city which has
        escaped the pestilence.”
    </p>

    <p>
        And he said,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span> “By the respect I owe to my fathers, who are not dead but
        sleep, awaiting the day of triumph, I swear to thee. It is an oath that
        cannot be broken.” And his dark eyes flashed, and no sign of deceit
        appeared in his face; and Daphne said, “I trust thee. I will go.”
    </p>

    <p>
        And the other maidens gained confidence by what they had seen and
        heard, and, according to the word of the Egyptian leader, went by
        different ways and as secretly as possible to a place appointed for
        meeting, and they said nothing to any they met.
    </p>


    <div class="chapter">
        <span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
        <h2 id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.<br />
            <small>NEPENTHE.</small>
        </h2>
    </div>

    <p>
        Before they separated, the Egyptian leader gave to Daphne, whom he
        looked on as having authority over the rest, a powdered substance in a
        small linen bag.
    </p>

    <p>
        “This,” said he,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span> “is that Nepenthe of which your poet sings, the most
        soothing of all medicines, and known to the Egyptians from very ancient
        times. When ye come to our trysting-place on the coast, and the other
        maidens begin to be again afraid, mix this drug with sweet wine and
        they will forget their sorrow. Say to them that it is a remedy against
        the plague. As soon as ye have partaken of it, we will appear and take
        you to our ship. And in the ship ye shall find the female slaves we
        have brought, and good store of garments and precious things. So care
        for nothing but to escape as speedily as possible, for if the reason of
        your flight were known, all the Athenians would come, and in the crowd
        all must perish. Farewell!”
    </p>

    <hr class="tb" />

    <p>
        The place of meeting was a little sandy bay set in the midst of steep,
        rough rocks, and about two hours from the city. Encouraged by the
        spirit and example of Daphne on the one hand, and on the other driven
        by the fear of the plague, the maidens, a little before sunset, reached
        the appointed spot. At some distance they saw a dark vessel unlike any
        they had ever seen, for there seemed to be place neither for oars nor
        sails. It looked rather like the hull of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span> a wrecked ship than a vessel
        prepared for a long journey.
    </p>

    <p>
        The maidens in their trepidation were ready to start with alarm at any
        strange sight, and the black vessel, on which not a man was visible,
        seemed to them as dismal as the boat with which Charon ferries the
        souls of the dead over the Styx. They looked back already with longing
        to the city, and with fear they saw the long shadows cast by the
        declining sun.
    </p>

    <p>
        But Daphne was determined to complete the venture, and she prepared to
        give them the drug.
    </p>

    <p>“This,” said she, “is a charm against the plague.”</p>

    <p>“Perchance,” whispered one of the maidens, “it is poisonous.”</p>

    <p>
        But Daphne replied,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span> “Nay, that thought of thine is altogether foolish.
        Why should the men entice us away from the city simply to put us to
        death? Fear not,&mdash;I will begin.”
    </p>

    <p>
        She mixed the nepenthe with the sweet wine, and drank of it herself,
        and gave to the others, and they all drank.
    </p>

    <p>
        And then, indeed, as the leader of the band of merchants had said, so
        it happened.
    </p>

    <p>
        Slowly and dreamily the distant city began to blend with the clouds.
        The waves of the sea fell upon the shore with the rhythm of sweet
        music. The air became heavy with the odours of drowsy flowers and
        mystic perfumes. The sand formed a softer couch than the most exquisite
        cushions of the East. The maidens looked on one another with calm
        content. Fearless and careless, they gave themselves up to the misty
        shapes of languid pleasures.
    </p>

    <p>
        All memory of the past vanished, and vanished also all thought of
        the future. From the black vessel they saw a boat put<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span> off, and they
        watched its approach, as listlessly as if it were but the shadow of a
        cloud on the water. The sound of the oars was like the measured far-off
        beat of the wings of a flying swan. The men landed and seemed to murmur
        to one another in the ancient language of the happy gods; they lifted
        up the maidens, and their touch was gentle as the caress of a child.
        Then the day melted into the dark of evening, and one and all the
        maidens sank into quiet, dreamless slumber.
    </p>

    <div class="chapter">

            <small>THE MIGHT OF SKILL.</small>
        </h2>
    </div>

    <p>
        When Daphne awoke she found herself lying on a luxurious couch, in a
        low apartment lighted with hanging lamps. From the movement, she judged
        they were on the sea. Her companions were still sleeping, but the women
        slaves were awake, and moved about easily.
    </p>

    <p>
        Daphne arose and tried to walk, but her feet were unsteady with the
        movement. She called a slave-girl, and with her help reached the
        door. She found, from the slave’s report, they had slept a very long
        time&mdash;how long she knew not.
    </p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span></p>

    <p>
        Outside the door was a kind of ladder. She climbed up into the fresh
        air, and found herself on the deck of a large ship. A vessel of some
        kind it certainly was, for no land was in sight&mdash;nothing but the waves
        dancing in the sunlight. But the craft was altogether different from
        anything she had heard of or imagined.
    </p>

    <p>
        No sail was set, nor did there appear to be any masts. There were no
        oars, and no places where oars might be used. The floor on which she
        stood was a smooth unbroken surface, except for the entrance by which
        she had ascended, and two of a similar kind in different places, of
        which the doors were closed. No man was visible, and there was no sound
        except the lapping of the waves.
    </p>

    <p>
        At first she thought some dreadful storm must have carried away the
        upper part of the vessel, and left only the lower portion; but on
        looking, she found no signs of break<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>age or wreck, and discovered, to
        her amazement, that the sides of the bulwarks round the deck were of
        iron, or some metal, perfectly finished.
    </p>

    <p>
        The wind seemed very strong, but the waves hardly moved. She saw some
        birds in the water, which were, she thought, swimming at a great pace
        without any effort; then some beams passed with the same speed; then,
        as she looked more carefully, the waves of the sea seemed rushing past
        and breaking on the bows of the vessel. At last she found that it was
        the ship which, without sail or oar, or any visible power, was dashing
        through the water. She was awe-struck! Alone in the midst of the sea,
        with no sign of human power, the vessel was rushing through the water
        like some huge sea-monster!
    </p>

    <p>
        She made her way to the side, almost expecting to see great fins
        ploughing the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span> water, or a myriad arms clutching it in swimming. But
        she could see nothing, and hear nothing. Silently, without a jar or
        shock of any kind, the vessel sped on its way through a desolate waste
        of waters. The silence and solitude terrified her, and she turned to
        call her companions. She wished to know if she were still in a land of
        dreams, and under the power of the drug.
    </p>

    <p>
        But the sun shone with burning heat, the spray of the water was cold,
        the air was fresh, and everything she touched and saw seemed real and
        true. No phantom sea or ocean, she thought, could look so strong and
        glaring.
    </p>

    <p>
        Suddenly the Egyptian leader stood by her side, and as she shrank from
        him, he said, “Fear not! I have sworn an oath that cannot be broken.”
    </p>

    <p>
        And when she looked in his eyes, her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span> courage was restored, and she
        said, “Tell me whither we are going, and how it is that the vessel
        moves without sail or oars. To me it seems like wicked magic.”
    </p>

    <p>
        “We are going,” he replied, “to a country in which, if thou wilt, thou
        shalt be a great queen; and there is no magic, but simply human skill
        which moves the ship, though it would be tedious to explain the matter
        more fully.”
    </p>

    <p>
        Then Daphne mused for a time on the strangeness of her situation, and
        at length, after gazing fixedly at the Egyptian, she said, “Grant me
        one more promise.” And he said, “If it is possible, I will grant it.”
    </p>

    <p>
        “Already when we were still at Athens,” she said,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span> “I noticed thou
        toldest the other maidens things that thou knewest to be false, taking
        advantage of their ignorance. Now I am altogether in thy power and at
        thy mercy, and I am prepared for my fate, having escaped a horrible
        death through thy aid. But my request is this: whatever thou sayest to
        me, let it be truth&mdash;do not play with me at least, with idle tales.”
    </p>

    <p>
        The Egyptian seemed to reflect for a long time, and his look became
        gloomy.
    </p>

    <p>
        Then he said: “Already I have promised thee more than I intended, and
        the truth is too hard for thee to hear, or even to understand, for the
        present.”
    </p>

    <p>
        For a moment Daphne shuddered, but by an effort she recovered her
        composure, and said: “To avoid death by the pestilence, willingly, with
        my eyes open, I surrendered myself to thee, although I did not know
        even thy name. I look on myself as already in the under-world. Nothing
        now will terrify me, for thy vaunted oath I believe no longer.”
    </p>

    <p>
        The Egyptian replied,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span> “The oath cannot be broken, and whatever I say
        to thee shall be free from deceit. But there are many things that I
        cannot tell thee: whatever I say shall be true, but neither can I tell
        thee everything, nor could thy mind at present bear it, any more than
        thy eyes could look straight at the sun. My country is in many ways
        different from Athens. My name is Thoth.”
    </p>

    <p>
        At first Daphne was displeased to be treated like a child, but her
        curiosity was excited, and she began to ask questions. The answers,
        however, seemed for the most part to cause still greater mystery.
    </p>

    <p>
        Suddenly she heard a cry of alarm from some of her companions. They too
        had awaked, and had come to join Daphne. Just as they came near, at
        the other end of the vessel two of the merchants appeared, and began
        to eye the maidens with the look of curious contempt which at first
        had alarmed Daphne. She turned to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span> Thoth and said, “Why are these men
        so hateful in appearance? They fill me with dread, and terrify my
        companions.”
    </p>

    <p>
        A look of displeasure crossed the face of the leader, and he said
        sternly, “This shall not be. I will compel them to honour whom I
        choose, and in a short time I will give thee an undoubted sign.”
    </p>

    </div>

    <p>
        Thoth disappeared, and on his return said to Daphne, “It is necessary
        to encourage thy companions, and to show them that they have nothing to
        fear. They seem to dread my people, but I will make every man give them
        an undoubted sign of respect.”
    </p>

    <p>
        Daphne informed her companions, and according to the request of Thoth,
        they stood in a line leaning on the side of the vessel. He then
        summoned his men, and they awaited his orders in an attitude of the
        most obsequious deference. Then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span> Thoth advanced to Daphne, and taking
        her hand, said&mdash;
    </p>

    <p>“Permit me to show thee honour.”</p>

    <p>
        He bowed and lightly kissed her fingers. Then he turned to his
        companions, and choosing out the man whom he had struck in Athens, he
        said&mdash;
    </p>

    <p>“Kneel down and kiss the foot of this maiden.”</p>

    <p>
        The man’s face showed a strange conflict of emotions. Amazement
        struggled with obedience, and the strongest efforts at composure failed
        to suppress his loathing at the indignity put upon him. At length,
        however, he advanced and knelt down, and did as he was commanded. He
        rose immediately, with his face pale with displeasure.
    </p>

    <p>
        Then Thoth turned to another, and pointing to one of the maidens,
        said,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span> “Ask thou permission to kiss her hand.”
    </p>

    <p>
        Next to Daphne, she was the most beautiful of all the maidens, and
        the most courageous, and to kiss her hand was an honour worthy of the
        noblest. But, to the surprise of the maidens, this seemed to be a most
        difficult and disagreeable duty. The man obeyed his leader, but he
        asked for the favour as willingly as a coward might ask for death. The
        maiden laughed at the obvious dislike, and thinking it was due to the
        seeming dishonour, and being in her nature kind and generous, she said,
        “Nay, it is not so terrible. See, I will kiss thy hand first.” But the
        man drew back with signs of abhorrence much more strongly marked, and
        the maiden was indignant.
    </p>

    <p>
        The leader seemed for the moment surprised at the failure of his plan,
        and then his determination became stronger than ever. He commanded the
        men to kneel before the maidens, and to say in the most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span> distinct and
        emphatic manner, “We will honour all these maidens as we honour thee, O
        Thoth.” He then dismissed them, but instead of having been encouraged,
        the maidens were more alarmed than before.
    </p>

    <p>Thoth took Daphne aside, and said to her&mdash;</p>

    <p>
        “How comes it that thy courage is so much stronger than that of thy
        companions? We must make another attempt to gain their confidence.”
    </p>

    <p>
        He then gave an order to his men, and they brought up on deck a strange
        mechanical contrivance. In shape it was something like the body of a
        bird, and was composed principally of a kind of wicker-work made from
        some shining metal. The lower part was apparently solid. In a few words
        Thoth explained to Daphne that by means of this brazen bird, as he
        termed it, a man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span> could be carried with the greatest swiftness through
        the air. He commanded one of the men to enter the machine, and, to the
        astonishment of the maidens, in a few moments the bird rose in the air.
        It sailed round and round the vessel like a sea-bird in search of food,
        and then at a sign from Thoth returned to the deck.
    </p>

    <p>
        Then he said to Daphne, “This aërial boat will bear with safety two
        persons. Wilt thou venture to ascend with me? Perchance that will give
        confidence to thy companions.”
    </p>

    <p>
        Daphne at once assented, but the rest implored her not to leave them,
        and said especially that they were afraid to be left alone in the
        vessel with Thoth’s hateful men.
    </p>

    <p>
        The leader smiled with hardly veiled contempt, and said,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span> “That is
        soon provided for. See, I have but to draw this bolt, and the men are
        imprisoned below.”
    </p>

    <p>At a word the men disappeared, and the bolt was drawn.</p>

    <p>“Now,” said he, “enter, and in a few moments we will return.”</p>

    <p>
        Daphne and Thoth then entered the car, and again it flew round and
        round the ship. The maidens lost their fear in admiration, and one
        said, “To what height can the bird fly?”
    </p>

    <p>
        Thoth replied, “To such a height that thou couldst hardly see it. It
        will mount the air like a lark.” And to Daphne he said, “Shall we make
        a trial?” and she at once assented.
    </p>

    <p>
        Under Thoth’s guidance the car rose straight upwards to a great height.
        Daphne looked down with wonder at the vessel beneath, so far off that
        the maidens through the distance could no longer be distinguished.
    </p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span></p>

    <hr class="tb" />

    <p>
        Then suddenly she cried out in alarm to her guide. The vessel had
        disappeared beneath the waves, and there was nothing to be seen but a
        few of the maidens struggling and shrieking in the water.
    </p>

    <p>
        Daphne looked at Thoth. His face showed most unfeigned surprise and
        vexation. For the moment he seemed to lose his self-command, but it was
        only for the moment.
    </p>

    <p>
        Apparently without an effort he became as calm and unimpassioned as
        before.
    </p>

    <p>“Hasten!” cried Daphne; “descend to the rescue!”</p>

    <p>
        “It is impossible,” he said. “All will be drowned before we can reach
        them; and besides this, the car can sustain no more.”
    </p>

    <p>
        Daphne looked with horror at the composure of this man, and began to
        suspect treachery. “Didst thou expect this catastrophe?” she said,
        trembling.
    </p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span></p>

    <p>
        “Nay,” said he; “nothing was further from my thoughts. I can ill
        spare my men, and my scheme has broken down at the outset. It will be
        troublesome to replace the maidens.”
    </p>

    <p>
        The coldness of his manner seemed to Daphne unnatural and inhuman. “At
        least,” she said, “make an effort to save their lives.”
    </p>

    <p>“It is useless,” he replied calmly; “but as thou wilt.”</p>

    <p>
        They descended, but long before they reached the spot, the sea had
        swallowed up every trace except a few remnants of floating wreckage.
    </p>

    <p>
        “There is no time to lose,” said Thoth. “We must go direct to my city.
        The strength of my bird will just suffice to reach it.”
    </p>

    <p>Daphne sank down helpless and dismayed.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span></p>

    <p>
        Thoth applied to her lips a small phial, and she was powerless to
        resist. Again she tasted the strange flavour of the nepenthe, and again
        care and sorrow were dispelled from her mind. She heard Thoth say, as
        if to himself&mdash;
    </p>

    <p>
        “It is not possible that they would have dared to disobey and
        become traitors.... Yet they hated the women.... But what flaw was
        possible.... Truly chance is great.”
    </p>


    <div class="chapter">
        <span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
        <h2 id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.<br />
            <small>A STRANGE WELCOME.</small>
        </h2>
    </div>

    <p>
        When Daphne awoke from her trance, she found herself lying on a couch
        in a luxurious apartment looking on to a beautiful garden. The scene
        was peaceful in the highest degree. The sun was high in the heavens,
        and the air was laden with sweet odours. Strange coloured birds flitted
        through the trees, and seemed quite fearless.
    </p>

    <p>
        For some time Daphne lay drowsily looking at the garden, hardly
        conscious of the journey she had made. The past seemed a dream, and
        the present a dream<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span> within a dream. At last her curiosity led her to
        examine the details of her chamber, and she rose up. Hardly had she
        done so, when she heard in an ante-room at the farther end a clamour
        of voices as soft and thin as those of little children, and yet with
        a strange resemblance to those of grown people in the fulness and
        quickness of the articulation.
    </p>

    <p>
        Suddenly, through the opening of the curtain which half concealed the
        aperture, a troop of tiny little people rushed and ran up to Daphne,
        kissed the ground before her, and then stood still, as if waiting for
        her commands. She then saw they were really men and women of the true
        pigmy race. They were finely shaped, and had pretty, well-cut features,
        and without exception the most pleasant of countenances. They looked
        up to her just like dogs waiting for some notice to be taken of them,
        with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span> glances full of suppressed friendliness. It was very gratifying
        to her, after the strange dangers through which she had passed, to meet
        with such spontaneous affection from the little people. At a venture
        she spoke to them in Greek, and asked for food and water, and one of
        them immediately gave orders to the rest in the same old Greek dialect
        which Thoth had used.
    </p>

    <p>
        In a very short time a table was covered with all kinds of delicacies.
        The pigmies, Daphne observed, were very strong, and with incredible
        agility they avoided any inconveniences due to their smallness of
        stature, leaping on one another’s shoulders, and climbing with the
        agility of monkeys.
    </p>

    <p>
        As soon as Daphne had finished her repast, her little servants
        conducted her through a series of apartments, all appointed in a very
        elegant manner, and they showed her with pride everything which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span> seemed
        to them most beautiful and useful. They watched with evident glee,
        and yet in a perfectly deferential manner, for her surprise when they
        revealed some new wonder.
    </p>

    <p>
        Her greatest desire, however, was to know who the little men and women
        were, and this wish was only gratified to a very small extent. Their
        position seemed to them so natural, that they did not understand the
        meaning of her questions. In each answer everything seemed to depend
        on Thoth. To say that Thoth had commanded such and such a thing,
        seemed to them final. They could no more explain why they obeyed and
        revered Thoth as an altogether superior being, than they could say why
        the sun gave light, or a stone fell to the earth. One thing alone was
        quite clear&mdash;they were absolutely under the sway of Thoth, and yet
        the relationship was one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span> of thorough love and confidence. They had
        evidently been told to treat Daphne in the same manner, and they did so
        with the greatest joyfulness. They were indeed models of affectionate
        servants, and examples of perfect obedience.
    </p>

    <p>
        The admiration of the pigmies for Daphne was immensely increased when
        another of their tribe entered, and in an obsequious manner asked her
        if she would permit Thoth to pay her a visit, or if she would prefer
        to rest and recover her spirits. The little people were evidently
        amazed that she should be treated by Thoth with such respect, but they
        were too well trained to have any doubt as to its being right. It was
        Thoth’s message, and that was enough for their simple, affectionate
        hearts.
    </p>

    <p>
        Daphne was anxious to see her preserver. The vague sense of fear
        which hitherto his presence had always aroused was dissipated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span> by the
        atmosphere of kindly veneration in which the pigmies lived. Thoth, she
        thought, could not be very terrible when he was regarded with so much
        affection by these childlike men and women.
    </p>

    <p>
        On the contrary, he must be a kind and gentle master, in spite of the
        example he had given her of his violence at their first meeting.
    </p>

    <p>
        Accordingly, Daphne answered with alacrity that she would be glad to
        receive her host, and immediately after Thoth entered and saluted her
        with profound respect.
    </p>

    <p>
        Yet in spite of herself, a shudder passed through the maiden. She
        looked through his eyes, but could not see his thoughts. She was not
        afraid of any treachery or violence. She believed his respect was real,
        and yet a nameless, causeless dread seized her for the moment. The
        little people, however, showed such undoubted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span> pleasure at being in
        his company that Daphne’s anxiety vanished, and she ascribed her fear
        simply to the strangeness of the situation.
    </p>

    <hr class="tb" />

    <p>
        Thoth lost no time in explaining the reason of his visit. He dismissed
        the little servants, and reminded Daphne, with all the calmness and
        dignity of an experienced ambassador, of the real object of her
        journey. He repeated again and again that no pressure of any kind would
        be put upon her, and that after she had become acquainted with the city
        and its people and governors, if she did not like to remain and to form
        a queenly alliance, she would be conveyed back to any place she chose.
        In the meantime she was at liberty to use the apartments and gardens as
        she pleased, and whenever she wished she could explore the city under
        his guidance.
    </p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span></p>

    <p>
        “Tell me,” she said, “is this the land of the pigmies, and art thou the
        king?”
    </p>

    <p>
        “I am not the king; yet in truth I might call myself vice-regent,
        and say that I have all the power of the king. As for the people,
        presently, methinks, thou wilt wonder if this is the land of giants.”
    </p>

    <p>
        “Will the giants be as friendly as the pigmies? Perchance they will
        frighten me. Are they huge and dreadful like Polyphemus?”
    </p>

    <p>
        “Nay,” he replied;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span> “though I said giants, they are indeed but
        full-grown men. Believe once for all that in all our land there is
        nothing magical or contrary to nature. Thou wilt find the giants as
        docile and amiable as the pigmies, but their duties are different. Come
        with me and see them; and it will be more pleasant for thee if thou
        will assume a disguise such as mine.”
    </p>

    <p>
        Thoth then put on a mask, and wrapped himself round in an ample
        garment. Daphne did the same; and but for being a little shorter in
        height, she seemed indistinguishable from her guide. Thus they sallied
        forth to view the city.
    </p>

    <p>
        Thoth carried in his hand a golden staff richly ornamented with
        sparkling gems.
    </p>


    <div class="chapter">
        <span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
        <h2 id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.<br />
            <small>THE WONDERS OF THE CITY.</small>
        </h2>
    </div>

    <p>
        At the palace-gate was a lightly built carriage with two beautiful
        horses, for Thoth informed his companion he wished to show her the city
        itself before he made her further acquainted with the inhabitants. By
        a winding road shaded with trees he conducted her to the summit of a
        little hill, and bade her look round.
    </p>

    <p>
        She saw at the first glance that the city was built in a curious rocky
        oasis in the midst of an illimitable desert. At her feet were buildings
        and gardens forming <span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>a large city. The buildings were widely scattered,
        and the whole place was about twenty leagues in circumference. It was
        surrounded by lofty walls, and beyond the walls, as far as the eye
        could reach, there was nothing but a burning flat of barren sand.
    </p>

    <p>
        The green spot on which the city stood, with the exception of the
        little hill, appeared to Daphne hollowed out like a cup; and it seemed
        as if the ocean of sand might at any time engulf it. There were no
        gates, and the country seemed completely isolated.
    </p>

    <p>
        A sense of forlornness seized on Daphne, and in spite of her courage
        she wept as she thought of Athens.
    </p>

    <p>
        Her guide at once divined her thoughts, and assured her that she had
        only to command him, and once more to be bold enough to mount with him
        into the air, and in a few hours she would find herself in Greece.
    </p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span></p>

    <p>Thus he comforted her, and her heart warmed to him for his kindness.</p>

    <p>
        They then drove through the city, and Daphne was amazed at the
        magnificence and beauty of the buildings and the luxuriance of the
        gardens. She saw very few people, and those were clearly of an inferior
        rank. They were of an ordinary stature and olive-tinted complexion.
    </p>

    <p>
        They stood still and saluted the masks with the most profound respect;
        and Daphne observed that the jewelled staff carried by Thoth especially
        commanded their reverence.
    </p>

    <p>
        All the buildings, roads, and gardens seemed in the most admirable
        state of preservation and good order. The city was evidently inhabited
        by people in the height of prosperity; and the thing which most
        surprised Daphne was the apparent sparseness of the population. Her
        curiosity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span> was aroused, and she asked Thoth if this place had also been
        ravaged by the plague; but he replied that no city in the world was so
        healthy, and that never in the memory of man had it been visited by a
        pestilence.
    </p>

    <p>
        The answer reminded Daphne of the speech of Thoth to the people of
        Athens, in which he told them that their indifference to the plague
        arose from familiarity.
    </p>

    <p>
        The reminiscence of the untruth was vivid and unpleasant, and she said
        to Thoth: “Which word of thine am I to believe? This agrees not with
        thy saying in Athens.”
    </p>

    <p>
        He simply replied,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span> “That was before my promise; but in reality both
        statements are true. We have had particular cases of diseases like the
        plague, but never throughout the whole population. Our wise men are
        great physicians&mdash;in time thou shalt know all.”
    </p>

    <p>“But how many people are there?”</p>

    <p>
        “The total number of men, women, and children does not exceed twenty
        thousand.”
    </p>

    <p>“And is this the only city in thy dominion?”</p>

    <p>“Yes.”</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span></p>

    <p>
        “How, then, canst thou boast of conquering the world?&mdash;and thou didst
        say so. Thine oath was soon forgotten.”
    </p>

    <p>
        “We have long since learned that safety and power are not in
        multitudes, but in wisdom and skill. Our archers, few as they are, are
        equal almost to Apollo. Thou hast seen that we can ride through the
        air, and thou shalt learn that we can perform other wonders unknown
        to the rest of the world. But it is best to begin with the simplest
        things. I will show thee our lowest class of workers.”
    </p>

    <p>
        They drove to a distant part of the city, and as they passed along, the
        signs of life became much more abundant. The dwellings, though still
        large, were smaller and much closer together. The people also were
        different in appearance, and the farther they advanced the more they
        increased in stature.
    </p>

    <p>
        At length Daphne understood that the great mass of the people must be
        giants, some of them being twice the stature of ordinary men. Their
        faces, however, wore an expression of pleased contentment, and they
        were most obsequious in their salutations. They were lightly clad, and
        the symmetry of their proportion, and the massive strength of their
        limbs, were a pleasure to the young Greek, accustomed to revere the
        great statues of the Athenian sculptors. She thought to herself how
        easily a small band of such warriors would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span> break to pieces any army;
        but Thoth said to her, “These are the most peaceful and quiet people
        in the whole world, and the most admirable workers when strength is
        needed. Which of your Greeks could contend with the weakest of these
        men?”
    </p>

    <p>
        He then ordered one of the men to cast a huge piece of rock to a
        distance, which he did with the most surprising ease.
    </p>

    <p>
        The women in this quarter were nearly as huge as the men, and, like
        them, admirably shaped, and, in spite of their great stature, very
        graceful in their movements. Daphne noticed, however, both here as
        through the rest of the city, that the women always retired to their
        dwellings on the appearance of the masks.
    </p>

    <p>
        But apparently to please Daphne, Thoth ordered some of the giantesses
        to approach, and they did so with every sign of being honoured and
        gratified.
    </p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span></p>

    <p>
        Daphne was delighted to discover that, with the giants as with the
        pigmies, the source of Thoth’s power was not tyranny. Evidently he was
        regarded as a superior being, but as yet she could not imagine in what
        the superiority consisted. It seemed as if the whole city was ruled by
        perfect obedience, resting on perfect love.
    </p>

    <p>
        When she returned to her apartments her little servants expressed the
        most lively satisfaction, and Thoth left her in their care, promising,
        if she wished, to show her more of the city and its people on the
        following day.
    </p>


    <div class="chapter">

            <small>THE DISHONOURED STATUE.</small>
        </h2>
    </div>

    <p>
        Day after day, Thoth conducted Daphne through the city, showing to her
        all its wonders.
    </p>

    <p>
        They were always masked, and were invariably treated with the same
        profound respect&mdash;no one even speaking to them, except in answer to
        some question of Thoth.
    </p>

    <p>
        All the inhabitants seemed to be people of great skill; and many of the
        arts which they practised Daphne would have thought magical, but for
        the constant assurance of her guide that everything was due<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span> simply to
        the accumulated knowledge of ages.
    </p>

    <p>
        She saw black charred wood changed into beautiful crystals, and
        transparent fluids transformed to solid images of exquisite design.
        Time itself seemed to be defeated at the hands of these cunning
        workmen, for, in a few moments, she saw a seedling grow into a plant
        with beautiful flowers, as strong and healthy as if it had taken a
        whole spring and summer.
    </p>

    <p>
        Space was conquered in an equally mysterious manner. In a few moments
        they were carried under the ground, noiselessly and apparently without
        motion, from one end of the city to the other. The powers of nature
        also seemed enslaved: the heat of the sun was made to turn vapour
        into ice, the air was constrained to lift great weights, and light as
        brilliant as the sun was drawn from running water.
    </p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span></p>

    <p>
        To her amazement, Daphne found that the solid earth had been
        honey-combed with workings, and forced to yield up abundance of all
        kinds of treasures.
    </p>

    <p>
        Streams of molten fluids were drawn from the centre of the earth, and
        compelled to separate into parts and to congeal into solid metals; and
        noxious gases were unloosed to drive intricate arrangements of wheels
        and all kinds of tools.
    </p>

    <p>
        Daphne began, unwillingly, to feel for Thoth something of the
        veneration in which he was held by all the people of the place. There
        seemed to be nothing which he did not understand perfectly, and she
        thought that it must be this superiority of knowledge which commanded
        such respect. Her interest in him was keenly aroused, for he seemed
        compounded of opposite elements.
    </p>

    <p>
        When simply speaking, he seemed as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span> passionless as snow; but when he
        removed his mask, his expression revealed sometimes a keen conflict of
        emotion. Though he seemed in general bold, determined, and inflexible,
        sometimes his eyes revealed a doubtful hesitancy, and pride and
        confidence often seemed to give way to despair and self-pity.
    </p>

    <hr class="tb" />

    <p>
        Once she said to him, “Is there anything left for thee to discover?”
        and he replied, with all gravity, “The very beginnings of knowledge
        are hid from me: my knowledge is a drop in an ocean of ignorance. I
        have climbed a blind path which, perchance, will soon be lost in a
        wilderness.” And then he relapsed into a melancholy silence.
    </p>

    <p>
        Occasionally, in their wanderings and explorations, Daphne saw others
        disguised like themselves, and treated with similar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span> deference by the
        people generally. Even these, however, showed to Thoth, on sight of his
        golden staff, the submission of inferiors.
    </p>

    <p>
        Daphne had been encouraged to ask questions on anything which occurred
        to her, and one day she said to Thoth&mdash;
    </p>

    <p>“Are there any superior to thee? Art thou really not the king?”</p>

    <p>
        “There is one to whom I owe the utmost obedience, and there are many
        equal to me in authority if they choose to exercise their power.”
    </p>

    <p>“And what do they?”</p>

    <p>
        He hesitated, and then, appearing to remember his promise to answer,
        said, “At present they spend their days and nights in sleep,&mdash;they rest
        to prepare for great deeds. I am vice-regent.”
    </p>

    <p>
        A strange people, thought Daphne, in which the king and his princes are
        sleepers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span> and yet some say that is like the blessed gods.
    </p>

    <hr class="tb" />

    <p>
        Months passed away, and Daphne began to think that Thoth must have
        changed his intentions regarding her.
    </p>

    <p>
        She had seen none of the other chiefs, unless those in disguise were
        such, and the disguise was thorough and complete.
    </p>

    <p>
        Sometimes, when half dreaming, she imagined that Thoth must be
        reserving her for himself; but in a moment the image of his passionless
        face, which never showed any emotion save that of troubled thought, put
        to flight the fancy. A marble statue seemed more capable of love than
        this superlatively wise vice-regent.
    </p>

    <p>
        Never by one glance or touch, or word or gesture, had Thoth shown the
        smallest sign of love for her. He treated her always<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span> with the same
        delicacy; he never laughed at her ignorance; and in everything he tried
        to consult her wishes. Yet Daphne was at that time one of the most
        beautiful women in the world, in the full pride of youth and health,
        and endowed with a mind capable of great thoughts, and a spirit of
        courage to the performance of great deeds; and Thoth was apparently in
        the very prime of vigorous manhood. The man was a mystery to her&mdash;a
        mystery surrounded by mysteries.
    </p>

    <p>
        Yet why had he brought her and tried to bring more of her companions
        thither, with infinite trouble and risk?
    </p>

    <p>
        And why had he made such a careful selection?&mdash;for the maidens were the
        flower of Greece.
    </p>

    <p>
        When her reflections were turned in this direction, other questions
        forced themselves upon her which hitherto a certain deli<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>cacy had
        prevented her from putting to Thoth.
    </p>

    <p>
        How was it that his companions had shown such repugnance and contempt
        for her compatriots and herself, whilst Thoth treated her with such
        deference?
    </p>

    <p>
        Over and over again she tried to detect in his manner some trace of
        dislike, but without success. Was Thoth of a different race?
    </p>

    <p>
        Then she wondered how the women of the highest rank were treated, and
        why the chiefs should have sought for strange women for wives. Many
        women she had seen in the city, but none who seemed of a superior
        degree, unless indeed some of the masks were women disguised like
        herself. At length she determined to ask Thoth, and the next time they
        met a mask she inquired if there were other women in her position.
    </p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span></p>

    <p>He at once said “No.”</p>

    <p>“Do any of the women of thy tribe use this dress?”</p>

    <p>“No.”</p>

    <p>“Do ye of the highest rank always seek wives from beyond the seas?”</p>

    <p>
        “With one exception,” he replied, “thou art the only stranger who has
        entered our walls since their foundation.”
    </p>

    <p>“Then are all your women dead&mdash;are none of queenly rank left?”</p>

    <p>“There are more of them than of us.”</p>

    <p>“Are they not beautiful?”</p>

    <p>
        For answer he led her into a building which seemed to be a kind
        of temple. He unlocked a massive gate, and conducted her into a
        well-lighted apartment. In the middle was placed the statue of a most
        beautiful woman.
    </p>

    <p>
        “Such,” he said,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span> “are our women by nature. Greece has rarely produced
        such wonders of form and grace.”
    </p>

    <p>
        From the statue Daphne turned to the walls, which seemed to be covered
        with statuary and paintings, and she started back terrified.
    </p>

    <p>
        A horrible fascination made her stare at the works, and her eyes drank
        in the meaning of the artist in a moment.
    </p>

    <p>
        All the highest skill of the painter and sculptor had apparently been
        exercised to pour contempt upon women.
    </p>

    <p>
        On the beautiful statue in the middle of the apartment a number of
        stony figures looked down with sneering hatred. This grouping she might
        possibly have thought accidental, but the pictures left no doubt as to
        the design of the whole chamber. In every case beautiful women were
        being treated in a degraded manner, and men of the same race as Thoth
        were depicted as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span> treating them with absolute loathing and disgust.
    </p>

    <p>
        Then in Daphne’s breast fear gave way to anger and offended pride, and
        she said to Thoth&mdash;
    </p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span></p>

    <p>
        “How dost thou dare to show such things to me? Is this thy respect and
        honour? Dost thou not know that man is raised above the beasts only by
        the reverence paid to women? I loathe thy city, thy race, and thee!
        Of what avail is all the miserable skill and cunning of thy slaves? A
        swallow or locust can fly more easily, a spider is a better spinner,
        and the tiniest flower draws more varied beauty from the dull earth. I
        scorn thy boasted reason. Liar and hypocrite! how canst thou stay in my
        presence? Throw off thy mask and let me see thy cowardly features livid
        with fear and shame. Let me see before I die that in this abominable
        spot one blow in honour of women has struck home. Take off that
        mask&mdash;wilt thou make me mad? Down with the mask, I say, or my reason
        will not hold till I can find a way to death. Thou shalt not make me
        mad, and keep me for thy lust and cruelty in this horrid den. Hast thou
        no dagger&mdash;no deadly poison? Let me die! Monster, make thyself human
        for a moment, and being human, slay me. I will not be maddened and
        polluted.”
    </p>

    <p>
        Such and other wild words spoke Daphne, every moment becoming more and
        more infuriated, and, in truth, approaching the verge of madness. At
        last she rushed at Thoth and tore off his mask with a passionate cry.
    </p>

    <p>
        His face struck her dumb with amazement. Instead of shame and fear,
        she saw wonder and triumph depicted on his fea<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>tures. Yet his look was
        rather like that of a spectator in a theatre who applauds a good actor,
        than of a man in real life. Certainly he showed neither contempt nor
        lust nor cruelty. The flood of passion in Daphne’s soul was swept away
        in momentary wonder, and she fell senseless to the ground.
    </p>

            <small>THE WOMEN OF ROYAL RACE.</small>
        </h2>
    </div>

    <p>
        When Daphne recovered consciousness she was surrounded by her little
        servants, all of whom manifested the most tender interest in her
        welfare. She was still in the same apartment, but every vestige of
        painting and sculpture had been removed, except the beautiful statue in
        the middle.
    </p>

    <p>
        Just as she opened her eyes Thoth himself was placing on the statue’s
        head a wreath of laurel, and a number of the pigmies were encircling
        the limbs and body with garlands of beautiful flowers.
    </p>

    <p>
        Thoth had resumed his mask, but removed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span> it as soon as he observed she
        was aroused. His features were perfectly calm, and saying “All shall be
        explained to thy liking,” he departed.
    </p>

    <p>
        The little people drew Daphne in a low carriage back to the palace, and
        she soon slept, wearied with her passion and wonder.
    </p>

    <p>
        The next morning Thoth did not appear in person, but sent her a
        picture, which was obviously intended to soothe her troubled mind.
        It represented in the most accurate manner the room of the statue,
        with the walls bare and the image garlanded, just as Daphne had left
        it. But the chief interest in the picture lay in the fact that Thoth
        himself was represented as gazing on the statue with the most profound
        reverence, and as if supplicating for pardon.
    </p>

    <p>
        For many days he did not appear, and Daphne found herself constantly
        looking at the picture.
    </p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span></p>

    <p>
        Thoth was certainly a skilled physician, and had administered the best
        medicine to her mind. In time her repugnance completely wore away, and
        she forgot a little the horror of her recent anxiety.
    </p>

    <p>
        Later she reproached herself with injustice. She should have waited for
        some explanation. And then, as the time went by, she began to wish to
        see her protector again, and to wonder what he meant by saying to her,
        “All shall be explained to thy liking.”
    </p>

    <p>
        Still Thoth came not, nor sent any message, and at last Daphne sent to
        him one of the pigmies with this request, “All is well. Come to me. I
        would have the mystery explained.”
    </p>

    <p>
        In a short time Thoth appeared, and inquired with tender deference if
        she had recovered from her vexation and anxiety.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span> He spoke as calmly as
        if it were merely some bodily suffering she had endured, and in which
        he had no part. But Daphne said to him, “Fulfil thy promise&mdash;tell me
        why I was taken into that dreadful place, and with what intent those
        horrible designs were made.”
    </p>

    <p>
        He looked at her narrowly, as a physician at his patient, and said,
        “I know not if thou canst bear it; and yet everything hangs upon this
        mystery,&mdash;the object of our journey to Athens&mdash;the nature of our rule
        in this city&mdash;ay, and the future of the whole human race.”
    </p>

    <p>
        He spoke slowly and with the most distinct articulation, and the last
        words were uttered with all the solemnity of a priest interpreting
        the signs of a great national disaster. He seemed even to increase in
        stature, and Daphne was overcome with his impressive dignity.
    </p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span></p>

    <p>“Tell me everything, I implore thee,” she said.</p>

    <p>
        “Come, then,” he replied; “but arm thine heart with triple brass, for
        this time it is living women thou must see. Take care, however, to stay
        thy reproaches till thou hast heard all. Know always that it is my
        intention to pay honour to thee, and through thee to all women. But the
        women thou must see first of all will perchance again alarm thee. Art
        thou strong enough?”
    </p>

    <p>
        Daphne shuddered, but she was determined to understand the affair, and
        she replied, “Lead the way.”
    </p>

    <hr class="tb" />

    <p>
        Thoth conducted her to a part of the city to which they had never
        before been, and they stopped at a narrow gate in a lofty wall. Thoth
        unlocked the gate, and they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span> entered a spacious garden, in the midst of
        which was placed a huge building.
    </p>

    <p>
        Scarcely had they passed through the gate when Daphne heard cries of
        alarm, apparently from women, and saw some figures vanish through the
        trees in a hurried, fearful manner. For the first time since she had
        come to the city she noticed signs of distrust and fear. Here, at any
        rate, Thoth’s rule seemed to rest not on love but on tyranny.
    </p>

    <p>
        Such was Daphne’s first impression, for the women, if women they were,
        were plainly terror-stricken.
    </p>

    <p>
        They passed into the building, at the gate of which a huge giantess
        of hideous aspect presented Thoth with a scroll, which seemed to be a
        carefully kept record.
    </p>

    <p>
        They entered a large hall, and again Daphne saw the same horrible
        designs as before.
    </p>

    <p>
        Thoth said to her,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span> “These, too, shall be destroyed, but first we must
        look to the living.”
    </p>

    <p>
        At intervals along the hall Daphne observed curtains, and stopping
        before one of them, Thoth drew it aside and revealed a small cell.
    </p>

    <p>
        Crouching at the back, like a terrified animal, lay a woman, scantily
        clad in a tattered garment made of coarse hair.
    </p>

    <p>
        Her figure seemed robust and healthy, but was rendered hideous by
        glaring streaks of paint and devices of unclean animals branded on the
        skin. Still more horrible was her head. She was evidently young, but
        she had no ears, no eyebrows, no hair. Her mouth had been distended,
        and her teeth were sharpened to fine points. She grovelled on the
        ground, as if awaiting torture, and Daphne’s heart stood still with
        horror and indignation.
    </p>

    <p>
        Suddenly Thoth addressed the creature<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span> in an unknown tongue, and after
        repeating the same thing over and over again, apparently made the woman
        understand and believe what he said, for suddenly she gave a sobbing
        laugh and crouched to kiss his feet.
    </p>

    <p>
        “I have told her,” said Thoth, “that she need labour no more at her
        appointed tasks, and will never again be punished. But the thing which
        pleased her most, and which she could not believe, was that without her
        request she would never see any of the masked rulers.”
    </p>

    <p>“What were her tasks?” Daphne asked.</p>

    <p>
        “It would be difficult to explain,” said Thoth.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span> “They were all most
        irksome, most useless, most trifling, but they were exacted with
        dreadful punishments. She had to count grains of sand, to unravel
        tangled knots, to learn by rote strings of meaningless sounds, and to
        discover all kinds of intricate puzzles.”
    </p>

    <p>
        To confirm his words, Thoth destroyed the various instruments of
        labour, scattered the sand, tore up the parchments, and stamped upon
        the fragments of the broken toys. The woman seemed stupefied with
        incredulous surprise, like a dazed child just recovered from a fit of
        terror.
    </p>

    <p>
        They passed on, and Thoth drew the curtain of another cell. Here again
        the occupant was a woman, but she was exquisitely clothed, and both
        face and form were extremely beautiful. She shuddered when the masks
        entered, and hastily began to arrange in a harmonious manner various
        shades of coloured stuffs. She looked anxiously, too, at the walls of
        the cell, which were covered with pictures. To Daphne the pictures were
        perfectly unintelligible, and yet they seemed excellent both in colour
        and drawing. They were such pictures as might be painted by a great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
        artist whose reason had been destroyed by some calamity.
    </p>

    <p>
        “Her task,” said Thoth, “is to live entirely for colour and form&mdash;in
        all other respects she is less intelligent than a butterfly.”
    </p>

    <p>
        Daphne looked into her eyes, and saw at once that she was quite
        distraught.
    </p>

    <p>
        Again Thoth repeated the same gibberish, and at last seemed to make the
        woman understand in a blinking manner that her life would no longer
        be made a burden. To Daphne, however, it seemed that the message of
        release had come too late&mdash;like longed-for rain after the tree has
        perished with drought.
    </p>

    <p>
        Suddenly a thought flashed through her mind, and without asking Thoth’s
        permission, she threw off her disguise and addressed the artist. At
        once she uttered a low cry of pleasure, and ran to embrace<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span> Daphne.
        Then she turned to Thoth and spoke to him in broken words. At Daphne’s
        request Thoth acted as interpreter, and told her the woman wished
        Daphne to remain as her companion. Daphne wept with pity, and Thoth led
        her away, the artist in vain trying to repress a cry of despair.
    </p>

    <p>
        Thus they visited room after room, and through all the variety of
        occupations in which the miserable women were engaged, the same
        features were conspicuous. Their labour was, without exception, either
        most irksome, most useless, most trifling, or else degrading, and yet
        it evidently required the highest degree of cunning and perseverance.
    </p>

    <p>
        In appearance, many of the women had been made physically most
        repulsive,&mdash;some maimed, some blind, some almost shapeless with
        distortion; and those whose bodies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span> had escaped, had been deformed to
        a much worse extent in mind. Without exception they shuddered on the
        entry of the masks, and showed their terror in the most undisguised
        manner. Apparently Thoth tried to take away their fears, and to inform
        them that for the future they would live happily; but they listened
        with dull incredulity, and seemed quite hopeless.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the whole of this vast building there was not a single creature who
        could have kindled a spark of love in the heart of the most impassioned
        of men.
    </p>

    <p>
        Daphne was sickened by the spectacle, and oppressed with a heavy weight
        of sadness. She tried to escape, but her companion told her it was
        necessary for her to see more, and that he would show her the least
        revolting of the women. Daphne shrank from imagining what worse horrors
        the building might contain.
    </p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span></p>

    <p>
        When they at last emerged the very sunlight seemed polluted, and the
        fresh air laden with pestilence.
    </p>

    <p>
        As they made their way to the gate, Thoth spoke to the hideous
        giantess, and she showed the same surprise as her captives. To her
        Thoth spoke in a tongue which Daphne understood, and told her that she
        was to be replaced, and that until another guardian came, she was to
        leave the women unmolested. The ogress ventured to remonstrate, but
        at the first sentence Thoth sternly cried, “Darest thou question me?”
        and touched her hand with the end of his golden staff, whereupon the
        monster fell as one dead. As if to excuse himself, Thoth said&mdash;
    </p>

    <p>“There is no further use for her: it is better thus.”</p>

    <p>Then said Daphne, “Is she dead?”</p>

    <p>
        “Yes,” he replied,&mdash;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>“dead beyond all aid; and to all her kind will I
        do likewise.”
    </p>

    <p>
        They passed through the gate, and as before, every one they saw treated
        Thoth with the utmost respect and reverence. But Daphne was silent,
        weary, and despondent.
    </p>

    <p>
        The horrors she had witnessed seemed to pervade every nook and cranny
        of the place. Helplessly she walked by the side of Thoth, and the
        salutations of her little servants when she entered her dwelling seemed
        to be as unreal and distant as if they came from the sky.
    </p>

    <p>
        She felt for the first time her reason totter&mdash;she had not strength
        sufficient to wish to flee from the place, or to rush upon her death.
        At last she wept passionately, and sank into a troubled sleep.
    </p>

            <small>THE MYSTERY OF THE WOMEN RESOLVED.</small>
        </h2>
    </div>

    <p>
        For some days Daphne was utterly prostrated with the scenes which she
        had been compelled to witness. The present was joyless, the future
        hopeless. If she requested to be sent back to Greece, she knew not if
        the whole land would not be desolate; and, worse than all, she again
        distrusted Thoth, and doubted if he would keep his promise. She began
        to fear that she was reserved for some dreadful fate.
    </p>

    <p>
        Thoth neither came to see her nor sent any message, but, as before,
        left the seeds<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span> of hope to spring up in quietness. And as the days
        passed by, slowly and gradually the youth and health of Daphne began
        to dissipate the gloomy memories, and wonder and love of life took the
        place of heaviness of spirit and fear of death.
    </p>

    <p>
        To her own surprise she again formed the wish to see Thoth, and at
        times almost believed that he would in some wonderful manner convert
        the scenes which she had witnessed into an unreal dream. But the belief
        was momentary and evanescent, and she shuddered as she thought of the
        plight of the miserable women and their deplorable state. Alive they
        were certainly, and living a life worse than death. Hope rose again,
        however, when she thought of the apparent kindness of Thoth, and then
        she tried to imagine that he was to be the saviour of the women who had
        been cruelly ill-treated by others. Surely, she thought,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span> he himself
        can never have been guilty of such crimes.
    </p>

    <p>
        When her thoughts had become thus kindly disposed towards Thoth, he
        suddenly appeared, almost as if he had been able to read what was
        passing in her mind.
    </p>

    <p>
        His face was as impassive and immobile as ever, and he made inquiries
        concerning Daphne’s welfare as if nothing extraordinary had happened.
    </p>

    <p>
        But she shuddered at his callousness, and indignantly cried, “Unless
        thou canst and wilt explain to me the mystery of these women, never
        look on me again.”
    </p>

    <p>“That,” said he, “is my present purpose. Listen with care.”</p>

    <p>Daphne signified her assent, and Thoth continued&mdash;</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span></p>

    <p>
        “In order to resolve this mystery, I must first make thee understand
        how much this city is different from others in every respect&mdash;a fact,
        indeed, thou canst not have failed to observe. Tell me, apart from
        these women, what thinkest thou of our people?”
    </p>

    <p>
        “They are truly a wonderful race, and surpass dreams in their knowledge
        of arts and sciences.”
    </p>

    <p>“And, apart from the women, what sayest thou of the government?”</p>

    <p>
        “The people seem happy and contented, and they appear to live in the
        utmost obedience to their rulers through mere love and respect&mdash;except
        these women.”
    </p>

    <p>
        “That,” replied Thoth, “is the plain truth. There is no city under
        the sun in which the people are so happy, contented, and so easily
        governed&mdash;except these women.
    </p>

    <p>
        “And how,” he continued, “dost thou imagine this wonderful state of
        affairs has arisen? But it is impossible to divine, and I will tell
        thee.
    </p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span></p>

    <p>
        “Many hundred years ago the father of the rulers of our people, a
        man of a Grecian tribe, held a high office in Egypt. In knowledge he
        surpassed all men, and in knowledge lay his authority. He devised
        many just laws, and was honoured and revered both by the multitude
        and by the king and his rulers. Had he not been thwarted, he would
        have made the Egyptians the most powerful people of the world. But
        he was betrayed and deluded: some time I may tell thee the full
        history&mdash;suffice it to say that he was ruined and subjected to
        dishonour through the love of a beautiful woman.
    </p>

    <p>
        “Mark this&mdash;for it is the key-stone of our policy. He contrived to
        seize the woman, and with a number of devoted followers he fled away
        and founded this city. Of the pure Greek race were only my ancestor and
        this woman, and about half a score of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span> women and men. The rest were
        aliens, but all devoted to him, and prepared to pay him most implicit
        obedience, and his knowledge both of men and things was so great that
        he could exact any obedience.
    </p>

    <p>
        “He determined to found a new state entirely according to reason. The
        government was to be entirely in the hands of the wisest man, and this
        wisest man was to be first-born of this new royal race. For Thoth the
        first, as he is called of us, forced the woman who deceived him to
        become the mother of his children. And he believed, through the secrets
        which he had wrested from nature, that, by the careful choice of a
        mother, he could combine for the future the right by birth with the
        right by power and wisdom.
    </p>

    <p>
        “It is this careful choice according to types which has provided this
        city with dwarfs and giants, and with workers of all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span> kinds, with
        aptitudes for peculiar forms of art or science. Thou hast seen for
        thyself the results of the wisdom of the first Thoth. But as regards
        the rulers, he was determined that he would, in the course of time,
        utterly stamp out the love of woman, and replace it with loathing and
        disgust. To this end he himself treated the woman who had changed his
        love into hatred with the utmost cruelty and contempt. At the same
        time, in order to render her offspring healthy and intelligent, he
        compelled her to labour both with mind and body, and to live so as to
        unfold her utmost powers. How meet she was to be the mother of a race
        of kings thou canst judge thyself, if thou hast not yet forgotten the
        statue which was her image. Her sons were taught from their infancy to
        loathe their mother, and to regard their sisters as necessary evils.
    </p>

    <p>
        “It would only be painful and useless were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span> I to tell thee more in
        detail; suffice it to say that in the building of the women thou hast
        seen the natural result of this policy, acted upon for many hundred
        years. Our women of the race of rulers are simply intended to be
        mothers of particular kinds of men, and in the course of generations
        the men of this race have succeeded in acquiring for women a natural
        hatred and loathing.
    </p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span></p>

    <p>
        “Now thou canst understand why it was my fellows&mdash;who were also of the
        rulers, though inferior to me&mdash;treated thee and thy companions with
        such contempt, and also thou canst to some extent explain the mystery
        of the women whom I showed to thee. Thou seest only the will of the
        first Thoth manifested through his descendants. Two principles he has
        planted in all his people&mdash;perfect obedience to his vice-regent, for we
        say that our king is not dead but asleep, and love of knowledge and of
        toil. Thus in all and in us of the ruling race, our strongest passion
        is hatred and contempt for women.”
    </p>

    <p>
        As he ended his narration Daphne shuddered, for she thought she read
        in his eyes signs of lust depraved by malignant cruelty, and that
        he regarded her with all the loathing he had just described. Then
        she reflected on her helpless condition and on the misery she had
        witnessed, and swiftly determined to seek a refuge in death. Already
        with this notion in her mind she had provided herself with a dagger,
        and with a trembling hand she seized it. Then she raised her courage,
        and looking Thoth steadfastly in the face, she cried&mdash;
    </p>

    <p>“I at least will never be degraded, and thus I escape from thy snare.”</p>

    <p>
        She raised the knife, and was about to plunge it into her heart when
        Thoth seized her arm, and said&mdash;
    </p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span></p>

    <p>
        “Stay thy hand,&mdash;thou hast heard but half the story. Dost thou not
        wonder why, hating women as we do, and being most strict in keeping
        our race pure, we have notwithstanding sought to bring strange women
        from beyond the sea, and that we have paid them honour&mdash;I at least to
        thee,&mdash;thou dost not doubt that?”
    </p>

    <p>
        But Daphne replied with undisguised doubtfulness, “Perchance it is but
        some horrible device to make the cruelty more exquisite.”
    </p>

    <hr class="tb" />

    <p>
        “Nay,” said he,&mdash;“listen. A generation back one of our vice-regents,
        who was my predecessor in government and also my father, thought he
        observed signs of decay in the race of rulers. He applied various
        tests, and all gave the same result. There was a falling off both in
        mental and bodily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span> power. It seemed to him that in some manner the
        training and the selection of the women had been faulty, and being
        confident of the good results of the plan of Thoth the first, he
        ascribed the fault to a want of rigour. Accordingly he redoubled the
        labours and increased the tasks of the women, and, at the same time,
        treated them with still greater cruelty, for his object was to bring
        the mind of women absolutely under control. But desirous of confirming
        his view by reasoning from the opposite, he brought over from Greece
        a female child and caused her to be received with affection by the
        common people, and at the proper age made her one of his own wives. But
        the hatred of women was so strongly implanted in him that, though he
        treated her with forced respect and kindness, he could not show her any
        real love. Yet such is the nature of women, she loved him though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span> she
        lived in constant fear and wretchedness. So much did her lord despise
        her, that he took no pains to conceal from her the secrets of our
        government. He allowed her to discover that she was only the subject
        of an experiment, and that if her child did not show at an early age
        signs of superiority, he would be destroyed. The mother’s instinct was
        alarmed, and, by the aid of her old nurse, she contrived to exchange
        her son with another infant who had been destined to become vice-regent.
    </p>

    <p>
        “Thus, in a manner contrary to our ancient laws, her son grew up to
        become vice-regent. So long as he was merely a child, the mother
        contrived to see him and to pour upon him her affection; but when at an
        early age he was removed from her sight, she fell sick, and, as is our
        custom, she was doomed to death.
    </p>

    <p>
        “She perished, and later on I found out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span> the fraudulent exchange,
        and that I&mdash;for I was her son&mdash;had, as it were by accident, become
        vice-regent. But I also discovered very speedily by tests that we apply
        in these cases, that I was gifted with powers far above those of any of
        the royal race of whom a record had been preserved. I proved also by
        the application of new tests that the real decline in the royal race
        had been greater than my father had imagined, for he had not allowed
        sufficiently for the accumulation of knowledge.
    </p>

    <p>
        “Perchance thou dost not understand the whole meaning of this history,
        but it matters not, for thou canst not fail to comprehend the
        conclusion.”
    </p>

    <p>
        At this point in the narrative he paused as if in doubt, as a man who
        believes he has solved a problem suddenly thinks of a possible error.
    </p>

    <p>
        “It is strange,” he continued, speaking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span> more to himself than to
        Daphne, “that I, the vice-regent of the haters of women, should to a
        woman disclose these secrets. Yet there can be no error.”
    </p>

    <p>Again he paused, and then with firmness and dignity proceeded&mdash;</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span></p>

    <p>
        “Therefore have I determined, knowing that I am greater in mind than
        any of my predecessors, to utterly reverse this policy, and to restore
        women to a position of equality with man, and henceforth to deal with
        the ruling as we have always dealt with the subject race. Yet, fearing
        the effects of long subservience and degradation, I thought it best to
        go back to the origin of our race, and to bring maidens from the best
        State in Greece to form our new queens, as was the case with mine own
        mother. In all other respects I have kept up our ancient rules; and, as
        I shall explain to thee hereafter, I propose to carry out to the full
        the scheme of the first Thoth for the conquest and government of the
        whole world.”
    </p>

    <hr class="tb" />

    <p>
        Daphne had listened to his explanations with wonder, and a great weight
        was lifted from her heart. Her eyes bespoke gratitude and admiration.
        For a moment she desired to throw herself into his arms, to pour her
        soul into his, and, so quick is thought, to love with all her being the
        man whom but lately she had abhorred.
    </p>

    <p>
        It was, however, for a moment only that joyous thoughts thus filled her
        mind; for, as she looked in his face, she saw no signs of responsive
        affection. As before, Thoth appeared perfectly impassive, and if he
        showed any feeling, it was simply the satisfaction of a philosopher
        who has explained in an intelligible manner a difficult problem. He
        had, indeed, spoken of the change<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span> in the treatment of the women of
        the royal race in precisely the same way as he might have spoken of a
        new method of building the royal palaces. Again the spirit of Daphne
        was bowed down, and her hopes vanished. Thoth, it seemed to her, if no
        longer a monster, was yet not a man.
    </p>

    <p>
        She sank down silently on her couch, and waited for further
        explanations as listlessly as a man struck by a heavy blow waits for a
        return of his senses.
    </p>

    <p>
        But not long did she remain thus calm and spiritless, for Thoth had by
        no means as yet exhausted his powers of agitation.
    </p>

        </h2>
    </div>

    <p>
        “Before, however, we conquer the earth,” continued Thoth, in the same
        unimpassioned yet dignified manner,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span> “it is necessary to establish
        the new order which I have set forth in our own city. It is needless
        to say that this will be a matter of some difficulty. Thou hast seen
        for thyself how repugnant are women to our ruling class, and that it
        is their nature now to treat them with cruelty and contempt. Still,
        with us the task is not hopeless, and, indeed, is quite possible. For,
        in the first place, obedience to the vice-regent is by far the most
        powerful motive of conduct, and also, in every respect our higher ranks
        are slaves, not of any passion, but of pure reason. Therefore I could
        say to my fellows of royal blood&mdash;such and such are the reasons, and
        such is my will; and the obedience must follow as surely as day follows
        the rising sun.”
    </p>

    <p>
        As he spoke thus, a will of adamant shone through his eyes; but a
        moment afterwards the troubled look of one who thinks he discovers an
        error in his proof appeared in his face, and he paused for some time in
        deep thought.
    </p>

    <p>
        “But,” he continued,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span> “it is no light matter to upset altogether the
        growth of many hundred years, and to depart from the will of my great
        ancestor, who in all else showed the perfection of wisdom. The ways of
        error are as many as the paths of the sea, and I must take heed lest I
        go astray. Therefore I have determined on two things as preliminary.
        The first is no concern of thine, and I need waste but few words upon
        it. Suffice it to say that I will take steps to see that this change is
        approved by the first Thoth and all the vice-regents, as well as by the
        present race.”
    </p>

    <p>Daphne looked at him with horror and amazement.</p>

    <p>
        “Surely,” she said, “thou canst not go down to the grave and consult
        with the dead?”
    </p>

    <p>
        “That,” he replied, “is, as I said, no concern of thine. But nothing
        must be done to shake the bonds of obedience, and nothing left undone
        to avoid the possibility of error. The fortune of the whole world and
        of the future generations of men depends upon this act.”
    </p>

    <p>
        Daphne looked at him steadfastly, half sus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>pecting madness, but his
        dark eyes gleamed with intelligence and firmness of purpose.
    </p>

    <p>
        “Therefore,” he said, as if speaking to himself, “I will be advised
        by the first king and all the vice-regents. In this manner obedience
        and the rule of reason will even be strengthened. This is the first
        precaution.
    </p>

    <p>
        “The second safeguard,” he said, looking on Daphne as an archer looks
        at an arrow intended for a fateful purpose, “is of more interest to
        thee.
    </p>

    <p>
        “At first I had intended at the same time to compel all the men of the
        royal race to take for themselves honoured consorts of pure Grecian
        blood, but chance or nature willed otherwise, and thy companions have
        all perished&mdash;chance or nature,” he repeated, “not treachery&mdash;not
        disobedience,”&mdash;and again for a moment he seemed to doubt.
    </p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span></p>

    <p>
        “Thy companions have perished, and perchance it is better so for my
        purpose. For, after much consideration, I have decided that the best
        plan is to make at first a single experiment. Accordingly I will
        explain to our chiefs my reasons and intentions, and will offer them an
        example in my own person.
    </p>

    <p>
        “I will show them that it is possible to honour women without the
        madness of love, and that the children born of equals are superior.
        Everything shall be done with full deliberation, and an imposing
        ceremony shall be invented to show that I am not driven by the passion
        which our great ancestor dreaded.”
    </p>

    <p>
        He spoke rapidly, and Daphne listened to him without grasping his
        meaning at the moment. His words had entered her ears, but had not
        penetrated her heart.
    </p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span></p>

    <p>
        But in an instant every word became a flaming dart and pierced her to
        the quick, when he said&mdash;
    </p>

    <p>
        “Therefore, in two months from this day, with all imaginable pomp, I
        will make thee my queen.”
    </p>

    <hr class="tb" />

    <p>
        Daphne sprang up in the greatest excitement, and quivering with rage
        and indignation.
    </p>

    <p>
        “Thou stony image,” she cried, “know that I have not yet learned&mdash;no,
        nor ever will learn&mdash;to obey thee, unnatural one, inhuman! I would
        rather wed the lowest slave in Athens than thee. Has thy hideous
        descent left in thee no trace of manly feeling, and no knowledge of
        the heart of a woman? I would rather see the whole world desolate than
        mingle my blood with thine!”
    </p>

    <p>
        Thoth listened to her with undisguised<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span> astonishment, and replied to
        her quite calmly&mdash;
    </p>

    <p>
        “But what more couldst thou desire? Thou shalt be treated by every one,
        from myself downwards, with the most obsequious honour. Thou shalt be
        queen of the world, and the founder of the greatest race the earth has
        ever borne. Surely thou hast misunderstood my meaning. Say in what I
        have failed.”
    </p>

    <p>
        Daphne was somewhat soothed by the calmness of the reply, but her pride
        was still wounded. She resented the coldness of Thoth’s reasoning, and
        she replied with passion&mdash;
    </p>

    <p>
        “What more would I have? I would have one thing only, the first and the
        last&mdash;love&mdash;human love.”
    </p>

    <p>
        “And what,” said Thoth, with an appearance of intellectual interest,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
        “is love? What more than I have promised?”
    </p>

    <p>The innocence of the answer of this wisest of men disarmed Daphne.</p>

    <p>
        “Thy honour and respect could no more kindle a spark of love than all
        the power of the ocean could kindle a little fire. Read again, if thou
        hast the record, the story of thy ancestor, and know that I must be
        loved as blindly as he loved the woman who, thou sayest, afterwards
        betrayed him.”
    </p>

    <p>
        She glided up to Thoth and took his hand. It was cool and steady. She
        looked up in his face, but his features were unmoved and his eyes
        passionless.
    </p>

    <p>
        “Shall I tell thee,” she whispered, “how thou canst tell if thou really
        lovest with all thy heart? I have never loved, and yet I know.”
    </p>

    <p>
        By the strange contrariety of her nature, she suddenly longed to make
        this man, whom she had just addressed with scorn,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span> her ardent lover.
        For the moment she forgot herself and her situation. Pride and dignity
        left her, and she only desired, with all her force, to subdue this man.
        She spoke to him as if she loved him, fearless of reproach, unmindful
        of opinion.
    </p>

    <p>
        “Love me,” she said, “and one look shall make me tremble&mdash;one caress
        stop my pulses. My heart shall be lost in thine, like a drop of water
        in a burning desert. Nothing but death shall separate us. Wilt thou
        not leave the weary pursuit of knowledge, to read without effort
        the open book of my soul? Look through mine eyes&mdash;is not the prize
        worth grasping? Am I not beautiful, and throbbing with the fulness of
        youthful life? See, my hand trembles in thine, and for one look of love
        I would kiss thy lips.”
    </p>

    <p>
        She spoke as if in a dream; but suddenly the hardness of Thoth, like
        the blow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span> of cold steel, dispelled the fascination. She shrank back,
        her cheeks burned with shame, and she hid her face with her hands.
    </p>

    <p>
        Then Thoth spoke to her words which tore her heart in pieces, and made
        her helpless with dismay.
    </p>

    <p>
        “I regret,” he said, “that thou hast utterly failed to grasp my purpose
        and to understand my position. Dost thou think that I will surrender
        my soul to the madness of love? Shall I keep at my side a passionate
        creature who will seek to betray and thwart me, and destroy by her
        animal nature the toil of generations? It is easy for me to imitate my
        father, and to bring a child from Greece to train according to my will.
    </p>
    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span></p>

    <p>
        “Surely I will do this; and as for thee, thou shalt find a chamber in
        our women’s palace, and thou and thy children shall be the slaves of my
        will. Henceforth my oath is no more binding than if I had sworn it to a
        dog or a slave.”
    </p>

    <p>With these words he departed.</p>


    <div class="chapter">
        <span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
        <h2 id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII.<br />
            <small>A WEARY INTERVAL.</small>
        </h2>
    </div>

    <p>
        After Thoth had left her, Daphne fell into the most gloomy train of
        reflection that hitherto had oppressed her since she arrived in this
        strange city. Before, in her despair some gleams of hope had always
        appeared, but now there was nothing but black darkness. She had begun
        to trust Thoth implicitly; after the many trials of his good faith,
        her trust had grown into perfect confidence, and now it was shattered
        for ever. She had seen in the man’s eyes a most terrible manifestation
        of passion, and she had no doubt that she would be treated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span> even more
        dreadfully than the women she had seen in the abode of horror and lust.
        Worse than all, she despised herself for the way in which she had in
        reality led up to such a climax.
    </p>

    <p>
        Regretful thoughts succeeded one another rapidly. Thoth was evidently
        a great ruler, who had been accustomed to the most slavish obedience.
        He was, or had been, desirous of effecting a revolution in the
        treatment of women, and he had for months treated her with deference
        and tenderness. Had she rejected his proposal as calmly as it was made,
        had she not attempted to get fire from snow, at any rate he would
        have kept to his word and restored her to Greece. She ought to have
        understood how the nature of the man must have been distorted by his
        descent through generations of women-haters, and to have wondered at
        the advances which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span> he had made instead of expecting the impossible.
    </p>

    <p>
        Never, she thought, could she have become his wife, but she might have
        been his devoted friend. She would have encouraged him in his projects
        of reform,&mdash;she could have liberated her fellow-women.
    </p>

    <p>
        Now all was over. She felt covered with shame as she thought how she
        must have appeared to Thoth,&mdash;worse than a sensuous Persian&mdash;a mere
        animal. How he must have despised her when she actually suggested that
        he should surrender himself to her, as the first of his name to the
        woman who deceived him.
    </p>

    <p>
        She despised herself, and for the moment her spirit was crushed. She
        longed for some sympathy.
    </p>

    <p>
        She called on her little servants&mdash;there was no answer. She went to the
        door&mdash;it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span> was fastened. She was confined in solitude. She wept bitterly.
    </p>

    <hr class="tb" />

    <p>
        But after a time her courage and resolution revived, and she thought of
        the only means of escape now open&mdash;death by her own hand.
    </p>

    <p>
        The sun was high in the heaven, and the garden of the palace was still
        open to her. She determined to drink again of the freshness of life
        before she died.
    </p>

    <p>
        She walked along the beautiful paths, and watched with pleasure the
        birds and insects. Earth and air seemed full of life, and death seemed
        terrible. She recalled the wretched fate of the heroines of her native
        tragic poets. Before she had often wondered why they had not put a term
        to their sufferings by a moment’s pain. She knew now.
    </p>

    <p>
        It seemed to her a thing impossible in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span> nature&mdash;deliberately to take
        one’s life, even to avoid misery. She repented that she had not already
        done the deed when passion had given her courage. The point of the
        dagger seemed very cold and hard,&mdash;life seemed very sweet, and in the
        glaring sun the gloom of death seemed most black and dismal. At least,
        if permitted, she must wait till night.
    </p>

    <p>
        Then she thought on what might have been her fate&mdash;on love unknown and
        hopes shattered.
    </p>

    <p>
        Again her courage and resolution vanished, and she trembled. She longed
        with every fibre of her being for some creature to speak with. She
        almost began to talk to the birds and lizards.
    </p>

    <p>
        Suddenly her heart stood still with joy&mdash;she heard through the trees
        the twittering song of one of the pigmies, and she rushed in pursuit.
    </p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span></p>

    <p>
        She soon reached the little being&mdash;a tiny girl, playing among flowers.
        Daphne raised her in her arms and kissed her passionately with tears
        and laughter, showering upon her loving words and caresses. The little
        maiden responded with unmixed pleasure, and said to her&mdash;
    </p>

    <p>
        “Why does Daphne weep? What is her trouble? I will run and send a
        message to our lord. Thoth is very wise and good,&mdash;he can put an end to
        any trouble.”
    </p>

    <p>“Alas!” said Daphne, “it is Thoth who is the cause of my distress.”</p>

    <p>
        “Ah!” said the pigmy, laughing, “that is what we sometimes think; but
        it is never right&mdash;our lord is very wise and good.”
    </p>

    <p>
        “But,” said Daphne, “your troubles, little one, must be as small as
        your bodies, and this is a very different case.”
    </p>

    <p>
        “Nay,” rejoined the girl, still laughing;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span> “we, too, think our troubles
        very great and very new. But Thoth makes everything right. Now I will
        tell you what happened to me to-day. I was sailing in a little boat in
        the fountain, and I got to the centre and landed, and my boat drifted
        away, and I cannot swim. I cried until I slept, and when I awoke I
        found my boat at my feet, and I am sure that Thoth had put it there.”
    </p>

    <p>
        The charming simplicity and the guileless confidence of the little
        maiden renewed hope in Daphne’s breast, and she kissed her and said&mdash;
    </p>

    <p>
        “Wilt thou try to take a message to Thoth from me? But, alas! for my
        punishment the doors are fastened.”
    </p>

    <p>
        “They will release me,” said the pigmy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span> “when they hear my voice. I
        have done no harm all to-day. I believe Thoth must have left me in the
        garden to be thy messenger.”
    </p>

    <p>“But,” said Daphne, “thou wast asleep on the island.”</p>

    <p>
        “So much the easier to leave me,” laughed the pigmy. “But tell me the
        message, and I will run.”
    </p>

    <p>
        Daphne put down the child, and sat down herself, burying her head in
        her hand, and tried to think of a message which might move Thoth. Shame
        and pride, not unmixed with dread, made the task difficult, and the
        pigmy began to grow restless.
    </p>

    <p>
        “Shall I ask Thoth to come?&mdash;once before I took such a message for
        thee.”
    </p>

    <p>
        At last, urged by her affectionate counsellor, Daphne wrote on a tablet
        these words:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span> “Daphne still believes in the promise which Thoth made on
        leaving Athens, and prays in all humility that she may be restored to
        some Grecian city. She is not equal to the high position in which Thoth
        would have placed her. She is only a woman with the common feelings of
        nature, and no superior being. But oaths are binding even on the gods.”
    </p>

    <p>
        She sent the pigmy before her to the palace, for she was too anxious to
        accompany her.
    </p>

    <p>
        After a long interval, however, she followed, and found the apartment
        empty. The pigmy had been liberated, and a repast had been set in the
        usual place. Hope again arose in Daphne’s breast, though she still
        feared, from the absence of her little servants, that all was not
        well. She was too sick at heart to eat or drink, and waited in anxious
        expectation. At last night fell, but there was no answer of any kind.
        She lay down on the couch and tried to sleep.
    </p>

    <p>
        After some hours of the deepest silence,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span> she thought she heard a
        footfall near the head of the couch.
    </p>

    <p>She started up, and beheld Thoth two or three paces distant.</p>


    <div class="chapter">
        <span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
        <h2 id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.<br />
            <small>TRANSFORMATION.</small>
        </h2>
    </div>

    <p>
        Daphne’s first thought was, that the hour of her destruction had come
        at last. She clung to her dagger, and in the presence of actual danger
        her courage was restored to the full.
    </p>

    <p>Her face was pale, but her eyes flashed.</p>

    <p>
        She looked at Thoth, expecting him to utter her doom, but he stood
        silently with his eyes fixed on the ground, apparently in deep thought.
    </p>

    <p>
        How long they remained thus she could never tell,&mdash;whether moments or
        hours. Time was effaced, and she and this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span> man were all that was left
        in the universe.
    </p>

    <p>At last Daphne broke the silence.</p>

    <p>
        “What is my fate? Wilt thou keep to thy first promise or thy last
        threat?”
    </p>

    <p>
        Then Thoth raised his eyes and filled her heart with wonder. A thrill
        of fearful pleasure passed through her frame as she thought she saw in
        his regard no trace of hatred or cruelty, but the overpowering love of
        a strong nature.
    </p>

    <p>
        She was not left long in suspense, for Thoth said to her, with a
        trembling voice&mdash;
    </p>

    <p>
        “Daphne, I love thee as never yet man loved woman. Against my will,
        against my belief, in a moment, love has seized me&mdash;love as strong and
        irrevocable as death that, too, comes in a moment.”
    </p>

    <p>
        Then he advanced towards her, and seizing her hand, kissed it
        passionately.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span> He tried to embrace her, but she drew back, afraid. The
        change in the man was too sudden and unexpected. She knew not what to
        think. Delight was mingled with distrust, and she knew not which would
        gain the victory. His kisses inflamed her heart, but the horror of the
        past was too recent to be altogether forgotten.
    </p>

    <p>
        She longed to be alone, and yet, at the same time, she wished to ask
        Thoth a multitude of questions. She wished to know his whole nature,
        and as yet she was afraid to give him her finger-tip. Overpowered by
        the conflict of emotions, she sank down on the couch, and listened to
        Thoth as if in a dream.
    </p>

    <p>
        Thoth respected her diffidence, and for a time reason again seemed to
        take command of his nature, and he spoke calmly even of his new-born
        passion. The words of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span> love which she had spoken to him, and which, at
        first, had made no impression, had, he related, as soon as he left her,
        begun to recur to him as if she were still present.
    </p>

    <p>
        He was quite frank. He told her that he had ordered her imprisonment,
        and had even tried to think of the details of her punishment; but
        in spite of his strongest efforts, whenever he thought of her he
        recalled her passionate appeal of love. At first he was astonished and
        bewildered&mdash;the whole affair seemed to him incredible and ridiculous.
        But the memory of her grasp made his hand burn, and her beautiful face
        chased away every thought. Then came her message, and he felt drawn by
        an irresistible force to see her. It seemed to him as if hitherto he
        had lived in a dream, and had only just awaked to the reality of life.
    </p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span></p>

    <p>
        Again and again he described to her the revolution in his nature,&mdash;by
        endless comparisons sought to show her how sudden and complete it had
        been. His love was the sun banishing night, and hiding the stars from
        the cold contemplation of the astronomer. It was the sudden rebound of
        a tall young palm which had been bent to the earth with thongs. It was
        a storm of burning sand, effacing alike the road before and behind. It
        was the cleaving by an earthquake of the solid ground, swallowing up
        in a moment man’s handiwork for ages. It was the tree which blossomed
        once in a thousand years, the first flight of a bird released from
        captivity, the first living prey of the young lion.
    </p>

    <p>
        Then after he had exhausted language and imagination in portraying
        the degree and violence of his passion, the natural bent of his mind
        made him seek for an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span> explanation which would make the unreasonable
        reasonable, and the ludicrous full of dignity and pathos. He proved to
        Daphne that life is not truly in the individual but in the race: his
        race was a giant whose nature had been distorted for a long period,
        and then suddenly had asserted its strength. The loveless lives of
        his predecessors had, by a necessary reaction, made him capable of
        an infinite depth of passion. Love, instead of being stamped out and
        crushed, as the first Thoth had supposed, had only been stored up from
        generation to generation. It was a transcendent passion, which did not
        obey the ordinary laws of life and descent. It was part of the very
        nature of life, and could only be destroyed by death. Besides this, his
        mother was by birth a child of the instincts and passions common to the
        races of mankind.
    </p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span></p>

    <p>
        The search for reasons brought back Thoth, as far as was possible, to
        his former calmness of demeanour, and he began to talk of the future.
        He assumed all the time that the declaration of his passion was all
        that Daphne had required of him, and she had been too much overcome by
        surprise to interrupt the torrent of his eloquence.
    </p>

    <p>
        When, however, he spoke in a definite manner of their union in a short
        time, she was driven to take up an attitude of defence. Much as Thoth
        had advanced in her esteem, she could not at once respond to his
        passion, and she was troubled by painful reminiscences. She said to
        him&mdash;
    </p>

    <p>
        “Tell me one thing in all sincerity. Wilt thou still, if I wish it,
        send me back to Greece?”
    </p>

    <p>His face became gloomy, but he answered at once&mdash;</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span></p>

    <p>“I swear it.”</p>

    <p>“Even if I do not love thee?”</p>

    <p>“Even so.”</p>

    <p>“And if I wish it, thou wilt never trouble me again?”</p>

    <p>“Never.”</p>

    <p>
        “And thou wilt tell me everything, and explain every mystery in this
        place?”
    </p>

    <p>
        “Everything; but, Daphne, judge not hastily and harshly. For I will
        change every law and custom that is to thee displeasing. With thy
        love,” he continued, in a vein of enthusiasm,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span> “I shall be greater in
        every way than my great ancestor. He has impressed his will on this
        race for hundreds of years, and I will impress mine for thousands, and
        thy will shall be mine. Thou shalt be queen of the whole world, and the
        lives of the races of men shall be fashioned by thee. No goddess was
        ever fated to have such might as my love shall give thee for a dower.”
    </p>

    <hr class="tb" />

    <p>
        Thoth seemed completely transformed, and his whole being was tremulous
        with passion. Daphne felt her power of resistance failing, as the
        strength of a mortal fails before the desire of some deity. Thoth
        became to her the perfect embodiment of manhood and of love.
    </p>

    <p>She rose from her seat, and drew nearer to him.</p>

    <p>
        She looked through his eyes, and the depth of his devotion seemed
        unfathomable. She could doubt no longer.
    </p>

    <p>She raised her face to his, and he covered it with kisses.</p>

    <p>
        Then he whispered to her,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span> “Tell me what more I must do or promise.
        Must love such as ours await some ceremonial for its fulfilment? This
        is to me the beginning of life. Choose thou for us what form the
        marriage-rites shall take, for I, alas! know nothing.”
    </p>

    <p>
        At once the spell was broken, for Daphne remembered the horrible unions
        which the haters of women had hitherto made. She shrank from Thoth, and
        cried&mdash;
    </p>

    <p>
        “Leave me! leave me! How can I forget that the women of thy race have
        been wooed with torture, and that thou thyself in all likelihood hast
        gone through rites of ingenious cruelty. I cannot believe in a future
        that rests on such a past.”
    </p>

    <p>
        But Thoth rejoined with passionate eagerness, and with every sign of
        truth, “Believe me, Daphne, I myself ordained none of these things.”
    </p>

    <p>
        “But,” she said, “thou hast permitted these terrible customs to live,
        and thy fellow-rulers have been guilty.”
    </p>

    <p>
        “Canst thou not,” he replied,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span> “separate the past from the future? I,
        at least, have not offended, in this manner.”
    </p>

    <p>But Daphne made no response, and Thoth continued&mdash;</p>

    <p>
        “Every one who has thus done shall be punished in any way thou mayest
        choose&mdash;if thou wilt, with death.”
    </p>

    <p>“Nay,” she said, “I will be guilty of no man’s death.”</p>

    <p>
        “Then,” said Thoth, “I will change their natures, as mine has been
        changed. Wilt thou be mine if, in a full assembly of our ruling race,
        thou art chosen as the honoured queen of the new era?”
    </p>

    <p>Daphne remained silent, and Thoth said abruptly&mdash;</p>

    <p>
        “I must give thee time for reflection. I know that I shall never
        change. In seven days I will come for thy answer.”
    </p>

    <p>He saluted her with reverence, and departed.</p>

        </h2>
    </div>

    <p>
        Hour followed hour with unendurable slowness, until the appointed
        day arrived for Daphne to declare her decision. With sunrise Thoth
        requested permission for the interview; but Daphne replied that she
        would meet him at noon in the garden.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the absence of other counsellors, she had determined to take advice
        from the full blaze of the sun, and to listen to the voice of nature in
        the whispering trees and the peaceful murmuring of the waters.
    </p>

    <p>
        At length Thoth appeared at the time and place agreed upon. A glance at
        his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span> face showed that his love had grown with the lapse of time, and
        Daphne felt a thrill of delight.
    </p>

    <p>
        He saw the look of pleasure in her face, and with a cry rushed to
        embrace her; but by a gesture she stopped his advance, and said to him
        with forced calmness&mdash;
    </p>

    <p>“Thou still lovest me as much as before?”</p>

    <p>
        “Thou canst not doubt it,” he replied; and she read the truth in the
        trembling of his voice and the passion of his face.
    </p>

    <p>“Wilt thou consent to my conditions&mdash;the firm resolve of my vigils?”</p>

    <p>“I consent before I hear them,” he rejoined. “Do with me as thou wilt.”</p>

    <p>
        “They are hard,” she said; “but after what I have witnessed I cannot
        take less. First of all, every mystery of thy race and of thy power
        must be disclosed.”
    </p>

    <p>“I consent,” he said.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span></p>

    <p>
        “All thy people, including the ruling race, must accept me as their
        queen.”
    </p>

    <p>“I will compel them,” he murmured.</p>

    <p>
        “When I am thoroughly satisfied on these points, thou must return with
        me to Greece.”
    </p>

    <p>“I will go with thee to the ends of the earth,” he murmured.</p>

    <p>
        “And if,” she said, “when I return to my country, this city of thine
        shall appear, as is possible, too dreadful a place in which to dwell, I
        shall be free to remain?”
    </p>

    <p>“Thou wilt never wish to do so,” he said, with resolution.</p>

    <p>
        “And if, when I hear again the familiar voices of my native land, and
        see the joyous faces of the people, thou shalt seem to me an alien, and
        unlovable, thou wilt leave me for ever?”
    </p>

    <p>“But this cannot be,” he rejoined.</p>

    <p>
        “I know not,” she said;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span> “but if it should so chance, then thou wilt
        consent?”
    </p>

    <p>“I consent even to this,” he said; “but it can never be.”</p>

    <p>Tears stood in his eyes; and Daphne said quickly&mdash;</p>

    <p>
        “But if, as my heart tells me is more probable, I yield to thy love,
        and thy will becomes my will, then thou wilt, first of all, wed me
        according to the custom of the Greeks?”
    </p>

    <p>
        “That will I do most joyfully,” he said. “I will prepare to return with
        thee as speedily as possible.” And again he wished to embrace her.
    </p>

    <p>
        “Nay,” she said. “Thou shalt not touch my finger again until we return
        to Greece; and first of all, there is much that I must learn of thee
        and thy people.”
    </p>

    <p>“Ask, and I will answer,” he said.</p>

    <p>
        “But,” she replied,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span> “I know not what to ask. Teach me from the
        beginning. Thy city is planted in the midst of an impenetrable desert,
        and thy people seem few in number, and yet thou sayest thou wilt make
        me queen of the world. How can this be?”
    </p>

    <p>
        “Power,” he replied, “does not lie in numbers. We have weapons unknown
        to the rest of the world. The secret of our strength I will explain.”
    </p>

    <p>
        “Then,” she continued, “I would fain know by what spell all thy
        fellows are kept in such perfect obedience. And strange words of thine
        run in mine ears,&mdash;of death and sleep, of a king above thee in power,
        and of vice-regents whom thou canst consult. Even in this glaring sun
        the air seems laden with foreboding. If thou wouldst gain my love and
        confidence, clear away all these mysteries; for they seem to me in many
        respects contrary to nature, and certain in the end to bring down the
        wrath of the immortal gods.”

            <small>THE DOOM OF THE FIRST THOTH.</small>
        </h2>
    </div>

    <p>
        “The immortal gods,” said Thoth, “are but the vague memories of great
        men, distorted in passing from generation to generation.”
    </p>

    <p>Daphne shuddered. “Dost thou not fear to speak thus?”</p>

    <p>
        “I fear not,” he said, “to speak the truth. But listen and judge
        for thyself if the first Thoth, who was born more than two thousand
        years ago, is not greater and more to be feared than any god recorded
        in Grecian fables. Thou seest yonder the roof of a large building<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
        into which thou hast not yet entered. In that structure sleeps the
        first Thoth, surrounded by many generations of his direct descendants.
        Consider this well, for what I say I mean in all its fulness. This
        king and his vice-regents are not dead, but sleeping. Thou hast heard
        of the custom of the Egyptians of embalming their dead. That is but a
        foolish ceremony, the reason of which has long been lost,&mdash;it is the
        husk of the kernel of Thoth’s reason. He discovered a perfect method
        of suspending life for an indefinite period, and in the prime of his
        life his son and vice-regent, in accordance therewith, laid him down
        to sleep. He and his brethren also, at the appointed age, were clothed
        with the appearance of death, and a new vice-regent appointed. For one
        day in every generation our great father is roused from his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span> sleep, to
        invest his vice-regent with authority. I myself was so invested; I
        myself have spoken face to face with this most ancient one. Never on
        this earth was any solemnity practised by man so calculated to ensure
        reverence and obedience. From the middle of the throng of deathlike
        sleepers this man rises up, and in a short time feels again the full
        tide of life in his veins. He listens to the progress made in the
        achievement of his plans, and the growth of the power of his race. He
        commands his latest descendants to obey the new vice-regent, and having
        for one day put in force his reason and will, he again surrenders
        himself to sleep.”
    </p>

    <p>
        Daphne was awe-struck by this narrative, but with an effort she said,
        “And do not the other sleepers also awake?”
    </p>

    <p>
        “They,” replied Thoth,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span> “are destined to wake only when the task of our
        race is on the eve of completion, to take part in our final triumph,
        and that is no less than the conquest of the whole earth.”
    </p>

    <p>
        “Tell me,” she said, fascinated by a weird foreboding of horror, “how
        this can be?”
    </p>

    <p>
        “The task imposed upon us by the supreme will,” he replied, “has been
        twofold. In the first place, we have had to make perfect mechanical
        contrivances, by which we can journey with incredible speed through the
        air. That this has been accomplished thou thyself hast been a witness;
        and for each of the sleepers a car has been prepared which surpasses in
        speed the flight of birds and the rush of the storm.”
    </p>

    <p>
        Daphne recalled in all its sublimity her own aërial journey, and she
        could not doubt the truth of Thoth’s words.
    </p>

    <p>
        Then he continued&mdash;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>“But a harder task was ours, and that also has
        been at length completed. We have now at our disposal the means of
        destroying every living being on the face of the earth. The day is near
        at hand when these sleepers are to become the messengers of death. The
        earth shall be made desolate, and in time repeopled from this city.
        In a few hundred years all the world shall be inhabited by many races
        and classes of men, all perfect in their kind, and all governed by the
        highest reason.”
    </p>

    <p>
        Then Daphne cried out in horror&mdash;“Do ye intend to destroy all people
        living except those in this place?”
    </p>

    <p>
        “That,” said he,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span> “was the design of the first Thoth, and had the means
        been ready fifty years ago, such would have been the case undoubtedly.
        But, as I have explained to thee, I have formed the opinion that in his
        endeavour to exterminate love in the ruling class, the first Thoth made
        an error. Accordingly, we must save some of the best women of thy race,
        and if thou wilt thou shalt have the selection. Now thou canst judge of
        the truth of my promises, and I will make one promise more. Know that I
        have penetrated deeper than my ancestor into the mysteries of life and
        death, and thou and I can live in all the fulness of life for hundreds
        of years. Thus thou shalt be as a goddess ruling over the earth. Tell
        me, Daphne, if the prospect does not surpass thy dreams?”
    </p>

    <p>
        He spoke with all the enthusiasm of a man who is on the eve of
        accomplishing a most honourable deed.
    </p>

    <p>But Daphne answered him, glowing with indignation and anger&mdash;</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span></p>

    <p>“Thy projects seem to me abominable, and unutterably loathsome.”</p>

    <p>“How so?” he asked, with unfeigned wonder.</p>

    <p>
        “Thou speakest as if all mankind were noxious serpents and raging
        beasts. To me, a Grecian maiden, thou talkest calmly of destroying the
        whole Grecian race. Thou wouldst found a universal tyranny on universal
        slaughter, and so degraded is thy nature that thou dost not see
        anything horrible in such monstrous crime. I despise myself for ever
        having listened to thy love. Kill me, torture me, abuse me, I am in thy
        power, but never will I share in thy unholy schemes.”
    </p>

    <p>
        Then Thoth said to her&mdash;“Take heed; even my passion will not bear such
        a strain.”
    </p>

    <p>
        “I would thy passion were turned to hatred,” she cried, “for thou canst
        not hate me as I hate thee!”
    </p>

    <p>
        For a time it seemed as if anger and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span> scorn would altogether destroy
        his love; but Daphne quailed not, and in her wrath became even more
        beautiful and majestic.
    </p>

    <p>The struggle in Thoth’s mind did not endure long.</p>

    <p>
        “True it is,” he said, “that I cannot hate thee; my love is
        overpowering. But I cannot shatter to its foundations the edifice which
        my ancestors have raised. Rather would I make the whole world lifeless.
        I will give thee a day to reflect.”
    </p>

            <small>THE REVOLT OF NATURE.</small>
        </h2>
    </div>

    <p>
        At Daphne’s request Thoth departed, but as he left her he said with
        great emphasis&mdash;
    </p>

    <p>
        “Remember that I have spoken the truth, and if thou wilt thou mayest
        become queen of the earth!”
    </p>

    <p>
        His words excited her heart to a burning activity, and thought after
        thought rushed swiftly through her mind. At first she tried to persuade
        herself that he must have told her incredible fictions, but the more
        she thought the less she doubted. She had seen enough of Thoth’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span> power
        to believe to the full in the truth of his narrative. She had seen
        him with a touch of his staff strike dead the ogress, and she had had
        abundant proofs of the absolute obedience of his people.
    </p>

    <p>
        For a time, however, she wondered how a few hundred men could possibly
        destroy all the nations of the earth. She thought of Thoth and his
        dread compatriots flying through the air, and discharging missiles on
        the helpless people beneath; but even with this advantage it seemed to
        her that numbers must prevail.
    </p>

    <p>
        She said to herself, “Even Apollo’s arm would grow weary of such
        endless archery;” and then, suddenly, she remembered how the arrows of
        Apollo had smitten the Greeks before Troy.
    </p>

    <p>
        Plague and pestilence had been the shafts hurled from his bow. She
        recalled Thoth’s allusion to Apollo, and a dreadful pre<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>sentiment told
        her that it was in this manner that the nations of the earth were to be
        destroyed. In the same moment all the circumstances of Thoth’s first
        appearance in Athens flashed through her mind: she remembered the grim
        indifference of the false merchants to the plague, and it was but a
        step to accuse them of bringing with them to Greece this unheard-of
        destruction. She knew it had been ascribed to poisoned wells, that the
        like had never been seen before, and she became convinced that Thoth
        was the originator of this fearful crime.
    </p>

    <p>
        Then she wept as she thought that perhaps already the whole of the
        races of Greece had perished. This now became the most urgent object of
        her inquiry, and she tried to bring back every word, every tone, every
        gesture of Thoth when he had spoken of returning to Greece.
    </p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span></p>

    <p>
        With all the appearance of truth he had promised to restore her, but at
        the same time he had said she would not wish to remain: he had spoken
        of allowing her to choose other Grecian maidens to share her fate; but
        why had he not sent before another expedition after the first had been
        destroyed?
    </p>

    <p>
        Certainly the man appeared to have an overpowering passion for her,
        and under its influence he had seemed to speak the truth; but then
        she feared he might have coloured his narrative to please her in what
        seemed to him the best manner.
    </p>

    <p>
        Was it likely that a being so inhuman in other respects should hesitate
        at breaking his word, as indeed before he had threatened to do? From
        the past and present she looked to the future, and she saw at once
        that there was no time to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span> lose, and that she must decide on a plan of
        action. But what could one ignorant woman do against the mysterious
        intelligence arrayed against her? Plan after plan arose, only to be
        rejected, and she soon became aware that her only hope of defeating
        these enemies of mankind lay in Thoth’s love.
    </p>

    <p>
        Even here, however, there seemed to be an insuperable difficulty,
        for she knew now that nothing could ever induce her to return his
        passion, and she feared that a simulated affection would only hasten
        her destruction. How could she hope to play on a being gifted with such
        knowledge and strength of purpose? She dreaded also in her secret heart
        that by some magical fascination her mind would give way, and that she
        might be led, in the weakness of a moment, to sacrifice herself to him.
        She felt still how near she had been to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span> a complete surrender of her
        whole will to his.
    </p>

    <p>Would she have the strength to resist?</p>

    <p>Before Thoth returned, she had worked out her scheme.</p>

        </h2>
    </div>

    <p>
        On Thoth’s appearance Daphne advanced to meet him with all the
        appearance of friendliness, although filled with suppressed emotion.
    </p>

    <p>
        “Thou art,” she said,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span> “the most skilled of all physicians, and thou
        knowest well that time is the best drug for the uneasy mind. Forgive
        my weakness. The Greeks of all people are the greatest lovers of their
        native cities, and I, a Grecian maiden, cannot see why they should be
        destroyed. But I will listen to reason. Why, if I love thee, should we
        not live here, and happily rule this city, regardless of the rest of
        the world? Why not leave thy dread ancestors to their sleep?”
    </p>

    <p>
        She spoke to him with a soft enticing voice, and looked up to him as to
        a superior.
    </p>

    <p>
        “Daphne,” replied Thoth, “I have already yielded to thee the utmost
        that my nature will permit. It is useless to ask more. For two thousand
        years my race have toiled incessantly to create a new world. They await
        their reward. If I raise them from their sleep, they will never consent
        to forego their plans. If I raise them not&mdash;but I tell thee that is
        impossible. Rise they must, now all is ready, as surely as rises the
        sun.”
    </p>

    <p>
        Love yielded in his eyes to fixed determination, and Daphne’s heart
        sank within her.
    </p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span></p>

    <p>
        “The task I have already agreed to,” he continued, “is wellnigh
        hopeless. They will never admit women to an honourable place, unless
        they are assured beyond doubt that the choice lies between love and
        death. I must prove that my love for thee, in spite of generations of
        hatred towards women by my fathers, is stronger than ever love was,
        and also that their attempts to crush it have crushed at the same time
        life and reason. I will strain every fibre to have thee recognised as
        queen&mdash;but queen thou must be, first of all, of one city alone in a
        desolate world. And, mark my words, if ever this is to be accomplished,
        thou must aid me with courage and with a love equal to mine own. I must
        set thee before these men&mdash;face to face&mdash;and thou must say and do as I
        bid thee. If we fail, there is no alternative but instant death.”
    </p>

    <p>
        Daphne, still clinging to hope, replied&mdash;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>“I know little of thy race,
        and my wisdom is dense ignorance compared to thy wisdom. But, tell
        me, canst thou not begin with the living&mdash;with them who have not yet
        entered on their long sleep? Why should not thy fellow-rulers, as at
        first was thy intention, seek for equal companions? There are many
        maidens in Greece less difficult to please than I. Persuade or compel
        thy followers to do as thou hast done, and then thou canst show thine
        ancestors how well the plan has succeeded&mdash;after thirty years&mdash;or
        twenty.”
    </p>

    <p>
        “I cannot,” he replied, “make such a change of policy without the
        consent of my great ancestor and his successors.”
    </p>

    <p>
        “Then,” she said, “even thy union with me must rest on their consent,
        and yet thou didst speak as if thou wouldst compel them to submit.”
    </p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span></p>

    <p>
        “But I said, by force of reason and will. Know, once for all, that
        unless they approve of my conduct, I will not proceed.”
    </p>

    <p>
        “And what is to be my fate, supposing they do not consent? Thou wouldst
        not leave me to perish?”
    </p>

    <p>
        “I will do my utmost to save thee, and I will perish with thee if I
        fail. But fear not&mdash;all shall be well.”
    </p>

    <p>
        Daphne reflected, and every way of escape from the power of the
        sleeping tyrants seemed closed. She had hoped at least to gain delay,
        and had even tried to believe that Thoth might, through his love for
        her, disregard altogether the past.
    </p>

    <p>
        The future seemed more hopeless than ever, and she began to feel the
        courage of despair. If, she thought, this man were slain suddenly,
        would not the whole power of the tyrants be shattered!
    </p>

    <p>
        She said to him,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span> “But if thou wert to perish with me, how would it
        fare with the sleepers?”
    </p>

    <p>
        “We have never,” he said, “imagined that we could avoid all the
        accidents of nature. If I were to fail, there are others to take my
        place. In my absence in Greece another was appointed vice-regent, and
        for every conceivable emergency provision has been made. It is useless
        to discuss the matter further, or to delay longer. This very day thou
        must be prepared to face the assembly.”
    </p>

    <p>“And if we fail, whither shall we flee?” said Daphne.</p>

    <p>“Nowhither,” he replied.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span></p>

    <p>
        “And, after all thy promises, wilt thou leave me to the mercy of these
        haters of women? If thy love for me is real, and if thou art prepared
        to die with me, at least redeem thy promise and take me back to Greece,
        and there we can await our doom. Thou dost not think,” she said,
        anxiously, “that the plague has destroyed all the Greeks?”
    </p>

    <p>
        “No,” he replied; “I have no doubt that by this time it is spent, and
        that many survive.”
    </p>

    <p>
        “Then,” she said, “if we fail, flee with me. In any case thou wilt be
        an outcast from thy tribe. And I am very young, and life is very sweet.
        I would fain see my country and fellows again. And in some remote
        corner of the earth we might escape with a few companions from the
        general doom, by thy wisdom.”
    </p>

    <p>
        She looked at Thoth in a beseeching manner, and his heart became hot
        with love. He seemed lost in thought for a long time, and then said&mdash;
    </p>

    <p>
        “If we fail, I shall be, as thou sayest, an outcast; and the little
        delay that thou prayest for may be granted.
    </p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span></p>

    <p>“Listen to my plan.</p>

    <p>
        “I have discovered recently a most curious and powerful substance. I
        can, by breaking a small vessel, fill the council-chamber with a vapour
        which shall at once send into a heavy sleep all present, unless they
        are prepared by an antidote. The drug is the most powerful of all our
        agents of destruction yet discovered. In a few hours the sleep will
        end in irrevocable death unless the remedy is applied, and then the
        recovery is slow. For love of thee, if we fail, I will use this means
        for a little delay. We will then prepare everything for flight, and
        only just before we depart will I administer the remedy.
    </p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span></p>

    <p>
        “Thus we may gain a few hours’ start, and in essence I shall not fail
        in my obedience. But I hope for a better result, and that reason
        will prevail, and thou wilt become the queen of the earth, and not a
        wanderer over a desolate earth with an outcast man. Rouse thy courage,
        and at the fitting time be prepared to speak as I shall bid thee. Let
        them see that thou art worthy of the highest honour.”
    </p>

    <p>“What must I say?”</p>

    <p>
        “After,” he replied, “I have explained the reasons for restoring women
        to love and honour, thou must say two things.
    </p>

    <p>
        “First, thou must profess the most profound admiration for everything
        in this city, and, with all the excess usual in a pervert, encourage
        them to hasten the destruction of the earth.”
    </p>

    <p>“That is a hard task,” she replied.</p>

    <p>
        “Why?” he asked. “War is the greatest course of glory, and universal
        conquest might dazzle the most ambitious. All that we propose is war,
        on a scale and in a manner hitherto not attempted.”
    </p>

    <p>
        “Thy words,” she said,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span> “throw a new light on the matter. Truly war and
        conquest are glorious, and the more thorough the more glorious. Greeks
        have before this warred on Greeks; and ye are, in your origin, Greek.
        My former disgust seems to me most unreasonable. Trust me, I will aid
        thee to the best of my power.”
    </p>

    <p>
        “Next,” he said, “thou must express thy ardent desire to leave the real
        government with the men, as before, and allow that women are by nature
        inferior, and that they may be loved and honoured to the utmost without
        fear. Thou must say that other Greek maidens would be more submissive
        than thou.”
    </p>

    <p>
        “This also,” she said,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span> “seems to me most reasonable. The arts and
        sciences practised in this city seem to me wondrous mysteries that no
        woman could ever penetrate. Women are born to admire power in others,
        not to exercise it themselves. Consider how soon I have yielded my
        whole will to thine.”
    </p>

    <p>
        Thoth was rejoiced beyond measure with these words, and the wisest of
        men believed with all the simplicity of a child that Daphne spoke the
        truth.
    </p>

    <p>
        But in her heart she had devised a cunning plan by which, unaided, she
        contemplated the greatest deed.
    </p>


    <div class="chapter">

            <small>THE ASSEMBLY OF ANCESTORS.</small>
        </h2>
    </div>

    <p>
        After some time Thoth returned and informed Daphne that all was ready.
        He clad her in her disguise, and told her to keep herself covered until
        he ordered otherwise.
    </p>

    <p>
        They paused before the building in which the council-chamber was
        situated, and Thoth produced a small cake and divided it carefully. He
        ate a portion himself, and requested Daphne to eat also, saying it was
        the necessary antidote in case of need.
    </p>

    <p>
        Then he said to her,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span> “Be not afraid, for first of all only those who
        are bound to obey me will have ears to hear.”
    </p>

    <p>
        They entered the building by steps descending into the earth, through a
        massive iron gate, which Thoth carefully closed after them. The clang
        of the iron sounded horribly, and the dim light made everything appear
        weird and sombre.
    </p>

    <p>
        They passed through many devious passages, and every one, after they
        entered, was closed by a similar massive door.
    </p>

    <p>
        At length they reached a spacious vault. In the centre was a kind of
        platform, and in the midst a curiously carved chair. Upon this chair
        sat a man with closed eyes and pallid face. To Daphne he seemed the
        image of Thoth.
    </p>

    <p>
        She glanced round the immense chamber, and it seemed almost filled
        with similar stone chairs, and in each of them sat a pallid motionless
        figure. They were ar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>ranged in circles round the central throne, but
        for a radius of a score of paces there were none of the sleeping
        figures. In this open space, however, immediately before the central
        figure, stood about fifty men in the same garments as Thoth, but not
        masked.
    </p>

    <p>
        Thoth, accompanied by Daphne, advanced to the front, and as they did so
        they were saluted by a profound obeisance, in perfect silence.
    </p>

    <p>
        Thoth took up his position beside the central throne, and placed Daphne
        on his right hand.
    </p>

    <p>
        “Are all the fitting preparations made? Have all our ancestors been
        brought to the light and set upon their thrones?”
    </p>

    <p>A murmur of assent arose.</p>

    <p>Then he spoke to the cloaked figures in a low clear voice&mdash;</p>

    <p>
        “At length the day of our triumph has arrived, but in the very hour of
        victory a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span> most difficult problem has arisen. In every respect save
        one the wisdom of our revered ancestor”&mdash;and he turned to the sleeping
        figure&mdash;“has proved faultless. But the continuous degradation of the
        women of our race has failed in both its objects. For, in the first
        place, I have proved beyond doubt that our ruling race has degenerated.
        With the single exception of myself, we are all inferior to our
        predecessors, and in the last generation, which should take your place,
        there is not one worthy successor.
    </p>

    <p>
        “And, furthermore, this treatment has failed to eradicate love, for,”
        he continued, drawing away from Daphne her mask and disguise, “I, your
        vice-regent, love this maiden most passionately.”
    </p>

    <p>
        A look of dismay overspread the faces of his audience. They started
        back, as if some monster, and not a most beautiful woman, had been
        revealed to them. Amazed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span> and confounded, they gazed on one another
        like men suddenly stricken with hopeless foolishness.
    </p>

    <p>Thoth eyed them for a time with curious contempt, and then continued&mdash;</p>

    <p>
        “Degenerate ye are in very deed, but it is not you whom I must consult.
        Recover your senses, and prepare to rouse the sleepers.”
    </p>

    <p>
        Thoth then gave certain directions, and his comrades dispersed. In a
        short time they returned to their former position, and Daphne observed
        a peculiar pungent odour, gradually increasing in intensity, pervade
        the air.
    </p>

    <p>
        Thoth took her hand and whispered to her words of encouragement. She
        knew that the eventful moment had arrived. Like a bird fascinated by a
        snake, she kept her eyes on the pale face of the sleeping tyrant.
    </p>

    <p>
        In a few moments his eyelids began to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span> tremble, and a faint flush
        appeared in his cheeks. Then he seemed to begin to breathe again. His
        lips parted, and slowly his eyes opened.
    </p>

    <p>
        Daphne glanced round the chamber, and saw that all the sleepers had
        been similarly affected.
    </p>

    <p>In a low voice Thoth said to her&mdash;</p>

    <p>
        “Fear not. They will regain speech and reason long before they can move
        their limbs.”
    </p>

    <p>
        She roused her courage, for though she could not doubt that the
        mysterious beings were living, their eyes looked dull and vacant, and
        she hoped that nature had become her ally.
    </p>

    <hr class="tb" />

    <p>
        The silence was profound, and moments seemed years in duration. Surely,
        she thought, this is but a momentary awakening of the dead.
    </p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span></p>

    <p>
        Suddenly, however, she saw the eyes of the ancient king gleam with
        intelligence, and she knew that both will and reason were awake.
    </p>

    <p>
        Thoth took his place in front of the king, and when he saw that his
        long sleep was broken, he bowed to the ground, and stood still, as if
        awaiting his commands. Daphne remained at the side of the throne, still
        unseen by the monarch, though in full sight of all the others.
    </p>

    <p>
        At last the lips of the awakened sleeper began to move, and Thoth
        presented him very gently with a curiously shaped cup. He sipped at
        first with difficulty, but after a time took a full draught.
    </p>

    <p>
        Then his face became animated, and in a moment he looked like a man
        in the full vigour of life. Still, however, he did not move, though
        apparently he made an effort to rise. He gazed fixedly at Thoth, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
        then spoke. The voice and accent of ancestor and descendant were the
        same.
    </p>

    <p>“Thou art my present vice-regent?”</p>

    <p>“I am.”</p>

    <p>
        “I see,” he said, “for the first time a multitude of my race aroused
        from sleep. Is, then, our task complete?”
    </p>

    <p>“It is complete.”</p>

    <p>A smile of majestic triumph passed over the face of the mighty ruler.</p>

    <p>“The cars are prepared?”</p>

    <p>“They are perfect.”</p>

    <p>“And the arrows of death?”</p>

    <p>“Nothing living can escape, such is their abundance and variety.”</p>

    <p>Again the king smiled with gratified vengeance.</p>

    <p>
        Then he said,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span> “A few days will suffice to regain the full strength of
        life in our limbs&mdash;already my mind is as vigorous as of old. At last,
        then, I become the ruler of the earth, and the races of men shall for
        evermore be such as my will has planned.”
    </p>

    <p>
        For a time he seemed lost in an ecstatic vision, as if the present had
        faded from his sight.
    </p>

    <p>Then he said, “This moment is worth all the toil and waiting.”</p>

    <p>
        He raised his voice, which every moment became more vigorous, and,
        speaking to the assembly, said&mdash;
    </p>

    <p>“Rejoice, my sons, with me.”</p>

    <p>
        He looked at the faces of Thoth’s companions, and suddenly his face
        darkened.
    </p>

    <p>
        “Why look ye so amazed, weaklings? Feeble and childish ye seem compared
        with your fathers.” He turned to Thoth. “Thou seemest indeed my son.
        Surely it is not possible that my strict commands as to life and death
        have not been obeyed? Speak,” he hissed&mdash;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>“are these the best of thy
        generation?” for they trembled and looked foolish.
    </p>

    <p>
        Then Thoth knew that the moment of trial had come, and he said with
        courage and simplicity, and speaking as if to an equal&mdash;
    </p>

    <p>
        “These, oh king, are the best of thy race of my generation, and all
        are born of unions such as thou didst ordain. Know, also, that their
        children are still more weak and feeble, and that thy royal race
        appears to be threatened with destruction.”
    </p>

    <p>The monarch grew pale with anger, and said&mdash;</p>

    <p>
        “My rules have not been followed. Some traitor has been a victim to the
        guile of woman.”
    </p>

    <p>
        Then Thoth replied,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span> “Hear me, oh king, with attention, and know that
        in one thing thy policy has utterly failed. The rest of thy people
        have become, from age to age, more vigorous and skilful, because their
        women have been treated with affection and honour. But thy royal race
        has dwindled. I am the son of a stranger woman, though my father was
        deceived and knew it not. That miserable being trembling there is
        thy true successor, according to thy laws of descent. Know that the
        degradation of women has failed, and thou must choose between love and
        death. My counsel is, that ye who have returned to life take for wives
        the best maidens of the ancient cities of Greece, and make honour to
        women the foundation of our new world.”
    </p>

    <p>
        Then he took Daphne by the hand, and placing her before the king,
        said&mdash;
    </p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span></p>

    <p>
        “This is the maiden whom I myself have chosen, and, in spite of
        generations of oppression, I love her as passionately as thou didst
        once love the mother of our race.”
    </p>

    <p>
        The monarch shook with anger and loathing, and in vain struggled to
        rise. “Traitor!” he cried, “darest thou thus to speak to me? Strike
        this woman dead on the instant.”
    </p>

    <p>
        But Thoth stood motionless, and said, “Thy whole power has grown out of
        wisdom&mdash;listen for a moment to reason.”
    </p>

    <p>
        “Dost thou speak of reason to me, son of an outcast? Ah, that my
        strength had returned, that I might kill thee with my own hand.”
    </p>

    <p>
        “Revered king,” said Thoth,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span> “I only ask for delay. Thou shalt examine
        the case thyself. Without thy consent I will do nothing. I have been
        faithful to all thy commands. The arrows of death and the aërial cars
        are at thy disposal. Had I been a traitor and a victim to the guile of
        love, thy sleep would have passed into death.”
    </p>

    <p>
        “Hold thy peace!” cried the monarch. “In a short time I and my true
        sons will be as strong as thou, and then thy doom will be swift and
        terrible.”
    </p>

    <p>
        A hoarse murmur of approval arose from the parched throats of the
        motionless figures.
    </p>

    <p>Then the king spoke to his latest descendants&mdash;</p>

    <p>
        “Are ye all traitors, weaklings? Seize them both, and tear them limb
        from limb. Ha! I feel my strength,” and he half rose from his seat.
    </p>

    <p>
        Urged by him, they began to advance, but Thoth eyed them with scorn,
        and, accustomed to obedience from their childhood, they paused.
    </p>

    <p>The monarch hissed with rage, and cried, “Advance! seize them!”</p>

    <p>
        Again Thoth said, “Revered king, listen to the voice of reason.” He was
        answered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span> by a louder cry than before, as the multitude of those who
        had slept rose at last from their seats, and painfully and slowly began
        to advance. The king himself in a moment seemed to recover, and tried
        to seize Thoth. But Thoth easily eluded his feeble grasp, and saying&mdash;
    </p>

    <p>
        “Once more, wilt thou hear reason? for I, as well as thou, have will
        and wisdom. One step more, and I plunge all of you once more in sleep.”
    </p>

    <p>
        “Thou darest not&mdash;thou canst not,” cried the king; and, inspirited by
        his example, all advanced against Thoth and Daphne.
    </p>

    <p>
        “Thus,” said Thoth, “I dare and thus I do!”&mdash;and he dashed to the
        ground a vessel that at once broke in a thousand fragments.
    </p>

    <p>
        In an instant every one except Thoth and Daphne fell to the earth,
        speechless, senseless, motionless.
    </p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span></p>

    <p>Thoth seized Daphne by the hand. “All is over. Come.”</p>

    <p>
        They passed again through the corridors, and the doors clanged behind
        them. At last they reached the open air and sunlight.
    </p>

            <small>THE VICTORY OF LOVE.</small>
        </h2>
    </div>

    <p>
        They passed in silence into the palace in which Daphne had lived since
        she came to the mysterious city.
    </p>

    <p>
        The pigmies hailed their arrival with their usual satisfaction, but
        Thoth dismissed them for the first time sternly. They entered the
        garden, in which the means for their flight had been placed.
    </p>

    <p>
        “We have no time to lose,” he said.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span> “Very soon I must return and
        restore my kinsmen. Before nightfall the great king will be in full
        command of the resources of the city.”
    </p>

    <p>“And then?” Daphne asked.</p>

    <p>“And then,” he replied, “his vengeance will begin.”</p>

    <p>“Dost thou not think he will be convinced as thou wert?”</p>

    <p>
        “I have made an irreparable error,” said Thoth. “My ancestor is
        swayed by all the natural passions of man. He has slept unaffected
        by time. His first thought will be to give us over to the most cruel
        destruction. If thou still desirest to live a little longer, we must
        flee at once.”
    </p>

    <p>“I regret,” she said, “the failure of thy plans.”</p>

    <p>
        He looked at her passionately, and said, “Thou canst never now be queen
        of the world, but a little love is sufficient recompense for me.”
    </p>

    <p>“Dost thou love me so much?” she said.</p>

    <p>“Above everything,” he replied.</p>

    <p>
        Then she went close to him, and twined<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span> her arms about him, and kissed
        his eyes and lips, and said&mdash;
    </p>

    <p>
        “Dearest heart, thou art greater and more godlike than all thy dread
        ancestors. Why wilt thou sacrifice thyself and me to them? Why should
        they ever awake?”
    </p>

    <p>
        Thoth started back from her, and said, “It cannot be. I cannot destroy
        at one blow the men I have worshipped&mdash;and the generations of my race,
        and their work of hundreds of years. Far easier is it for me to perish
        alone.”
    </p>

    <p>
        “Thou dost not love me,” said Daphne, “or thou wouldst prove thyself
        greater than this ancient tyrant. He is unworthy of thee.”
    </p>

    <p>Thoth only replied, “I cannot do this thing.”</p>

    <p>
        “Then,” said Daphne,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span> “choose between me and them. Unless they perish,
        my love for thee shall be changed to hate and loathing. Choose!”
    </p>

    <p>He looked at her face, and felt his will quail before hers.</p>

    <p>
        “What wouldst thou have?” he said. “I alone cannot carry out the scheme
        of destruction, and without it thou canst not become queen of the
        earth.”
    </p>

    <p>
        “I would rather,” she replied,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span> “tend sheep with thee on a lonely
        islet of Greece, than be the shadowy queen of a desolate world.
        Choose between my living love and this impious deed, which I am
        certain can never be accomplished. Thou hast failed already,&mdash;thou
        hast made serious errors; chance and nature have baffled thee in the
        most unexpected manner. Awake! arise! and leave this city and all its
        horrors, as thou wouldst throw off a horrible dream. Come with me!
        Treasures thou hast beyond estimation, and wisdom and courage. Thou
        shalt become a leader of living Greeks, and in a few short years the
        last remnant of these dreadful scenes shall fade away.”
    </p>

    <p>Again she approached him and kissed him.</p>

    <p>
        “See,” she said, “I will not let thee go. The crime is not thine but
        mine.”
    </p>

    <p>
        He said, “Leave me,&mdash;it cannot be. I will break their trance, and then
        we will flee away, as before thou didst agree. Time presses. Thou seest
        this shadow slowly creeping along. Before it reaches the spot on which
        we stand it will be too late.”
    </p>

    <p>
        He pointed to the shadow of a huge column, covered with curious signs
        and symbols.
    </p>

    <p>
        Daphne clung to him and whispered, “Let it be to them who hate me and
        thee the shadow of death!”
    </p>

    <p>
        She looked into his eyes with eager pas<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>sion, and saw signs of
        yielding. She redoubled her caresses, and whispered wild words of love.
    </p>

    <hr class="tb" />

    <p>The shadow came nearer and nearer.</p>

    <p>
        She covered his eyes with her hands, and showered hot kisses on his
        face.
    </p>

    <p>The shadow was close to them.</p>

    <p>
        “This,” she said, “is love such as the world has never seen. Let me
        lose myself in thee.”
    </p>

    <p>
        The shadow had passed, and then in her anxiety Daphne became cold and
        still.
    </p>

    <p>
        Thoth roused himself and looked. Then he uttered a great cry&mdash;“Too
        late; all is over!”
    </p>

    <p>“Art thou certain?”</p>

    <p>
        “Every one by this time is dead beyond recall. Thus ends the greatest
        scheme ever planned by man.”
    </p>

            <small>THE RETURN TO ATHENS.</small>
        </h2>
    </div>

    <p>
        Although Thoth assured Daphne in the most explicit manner that the
        whole assembly of the royal race must have perished, she insisted upon
        instant flight.
    </p>

    <p>
        The danger had been so great and the culminating events so appalling,
        that she desired above everything to be hundreds of leagues from the
        scene.
    </p>

    <p>
        Thoth became silent and gloomy, and most reluctantly agreed to obey her
        requests. Daphne attempted to soothe him, and to make his deed appear
        great and noble, but without effect.
    </p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span></p>

    <p>“Surely thou dost not repent?” she said.</p>

    <p>He replied as if he had not heard her question&mdash;</p>

    <p>
        “Canst thou not remain with me a few months in this city until I
        arrange some kind of order? There are none left now but the people thou
        hast seen, as harmless as sheep, and, without a ruler, as helpless. My
        brothers were weaker than I, but every one played some necessary part.
        If I leave the city without a guiding mind, a disaster is possible. Why
        art thou in such haste to be gone? Thine enemies are irrevocably dead.”
    </p>

    <p>“I fear even the dead,” she answered. “I cannot stay in this place.”</p>

    <p>“Not even with me&mdash;in the first glow of our love?”</p>

    <p>
        “Restore me to Greece,” she said,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span> “and then, if thou wilt, return
        hither and put in order the affairs of thy giants and pigmies.”
    </p>

    <p>
        “And this,” he said bitterly, “is thy love, when for thee I have
        sacrificed everything.”
    </p>

    <p>
        “Restore me to Greece,” she said; “I can stay no longer in this
        dreadful place.”
    </p>

    <p>
        He yielded, and in silence conducted her to the car. Then he said to
        her with gentle, affectionate persuasion&mdash;
    </p>

    <p>“Drink again of the nepenthe, and thou shalt awake in Athens.”</p>

    <p>
        She hesitated, as if with distrust, and he said with a tone of
        reproach&mdash;
    </p>

    <p>
        “Nay, if I intended harm to thee, there are still a thousand ways in
        which I could show my power.”
    </p>

    <p>
        She drank as he bade her, and again felt the strange soothing effect of
        the drug.
    </p>

    <hr class="tb" />

    <p>She was awakened by the words of Thoth.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span></p>

    <p>
        “Thou art at the rocks from which we departed, and the dawn is near at
        hand. Here is abundance of gold and jewels. Meet me at daybreak in the
        same place in ten days.”
    </p>

    <p>He kissed her hand and said&mdash;</p>

    <p>“I return to my people to set the city in order.”</p>

    <p>And without further farewell he entered the car and disappeared.</p>

    <hr class="tb" />

    <p>Some peasants found Daphne and took her into the city.</p>

    <p>
        The plague had vanished, and she found that many friends and companions
        had survived. When questioned as to her journey, she said simply that
        the vessel had been wrecked, and that she alone had been saved, and
        after much toil and suffering she had been restored to Athens by a
        man of Grecian birth, who wished to take her to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span> wife. She showed the
        treasures in token of the truth of her words.
    </p>

    <hr class="tb" />

    <p>
        Every day, as the old familiar life was renewed, the recollection of
        Thoth and his city became more odious to her.
    </p>

    <p>
        On all sides she saw vestiges of the plague, and she could not efface
        from her mind the thought that he and his companions had first
        implanted it in Greece. How could she love a man who had done such a
        deed?
    </p>

    <p>
        She began to dread his return. She knew not what to do. She feared if
        she let him depart from her in anger that he might renew the work of
        destruction.
    </p>

    <p>
        She feared to disclose the secret to the people and those in authority.
        She doubted if, against his will, they could overpower him,&mdash;and in her
        heart she wished him no harm&mdash;least of all, death by her devices.
    </p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span></p>

    <p>
        She could not forget the fate from which he had rescued her, and the
        sacrifice which he had made.
    </p>

    <p>The appointed day arrived, and still her mind was divided by doubt.</p>

    <p>
        Before daybreak she was at the meeting-place&mdash;alone. The scene of her
        former departure rose before her, and she wondered if again she could
        trust herself with this man.
    </p>

    <hr class="tb" />

    <p>
        The first light of day appeared, and she saw no one. The light became
        stronger and larger, and she saw, as it were, a large bird in the
        distance, advancing rapidly towards her over the sea. She knew that
        Thoth would soon be beside her.
    </p>

    <p>
        Nearer and nearer he came, and she pictured to herself his face aflame
        with eagerness and love.
    </p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span></p>

    <p>
        Suddenly, about fifty paces from the shore, without warning, the car
        fell, like a wounded bird, into the sea. Daphne waited in breathless
        expectation, and in a few moments Thoth rose to the surface, and,
        swimming with great difficulty, made his way to the shore.
    </p>

    <p>
        She ran down to meet him, and when he reached the land, she observed
        that he was pallid with suffering.
    </p>

    <p>
        The water at the place was deep, and the rocks rough and cruel. She
        bent down and assisted him to land, and as he felt her touch, a look of
        pleasure crossed his suffering face.
    </p>

    <p>“Art thou hurt?” she said.</p>

    <p>
        “My bodily hurt,” he said,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span> “is nothing, but I fear to tell thee the
        whole of my evil fortune. My city, with all its people and wealth and
        power, is buried in the sands of the desert&mdash;not a trace is left.
        There, in the depth of the sea, lies the last remnant of our skill. I
        stand before thee a nameless, powerless man. Yet if thou wilt only love
        me, I regret nothing,” and he looked with longing into her eyes.
    </p>

    <p>
        “Tell me but one thing,” she said; “assure me that thou thyself didst
        not bring hither the pestilence that destroyed my race.”
    </p>

    <p>His face darkened, and he said&mdash;</p>

    <p>“That is long since past, and I have become a different being.”</p>

    <p>She shrank back, and said&mdash;</p>

    <p>
        “At least, say that it was thy companions&mdash;that thine own hands are
        guiltless.”
    </p>

    <p>“Surely thou didst know before that I alone did it,” he said.</p>

    <p>Horror seized her, and she cried&mdash;</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span></p>

    <p>“How can I forget? How can I dwell with thee or love thee?”</p>

    <p>But he said with passionate entreaty&mdash;</p>

    <p>
        “Now I am altogether different. Since I knew thee, it is as if I had
        been born again.”
    </p>

    <p>But she looked at him with dismay and undisguised terror.</p>

    <p>
        “Alas! these are empty words, and the dreadful deed cannot be undone.
        How can a man be born again?”

        Thoth looked at her, and for a moment seemed to wait for some sign of
        relenting, and then he said, hopelessly&mdash;
    </p>

    <p>“Then there is but one course left.”</p>

    <p>He seized her hand passionately, and she tried to escape.</p>

    <p>
        “Nay,” he said, “fear no violence. I have always treated thee with
        honour and respect.”
    </p>

    <p>
        She left her hand quietly in his, and he raised it to his lips and
        kissed it.
    </p>

    <p>
        “Farewell,” he said;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span> “but hereafter, when thou thinkest of me,
        remember that my last words were true, and that the man who loved thee
        was not the man who did this wrong.”
    </p>

    <p>Then he turned, and, without a word, plunged into the sea.</p>

    <p>
        In a moment bitter repentance seized on Daphne’s mind. Her memory was
        filled with recollections of the kindness of the man.
    </p>

    <p>“Come back! come back!” she cried. “I believe thee! I love thee!”</p>

    <p>But there was no answer, save the lapping of the waves on the shore.</p>

        I, Xenophilos, physician and philosopher, having wandered forth to
        meditate by the sea, found Daphne in a swoon. For many years she lived
        affected by what appeared to be a curious madness, but before her death
        she seemed to recover somewhat, and out of her narrative I have, with
        difficulty, pieced together this history.
    </p>

    <p>
        I will only add that the body of a man, like one of the Egyptian
        merchants, was afterwards washed ashore. Near the spot, and many years
        after, some divers found the remains of a curious, unintelligible
        mechanical contrivance, partly destroyed by the sea.

        Philetos lay dreaming&mdash;dreaming that he was still hunting the lion. And
        it seemed to him that after slaying numbers of inferior animals, he
        lighted on one of an immense size, which, as soon as he came into view,
        fled to the mountains. He chased it through mighty forests, followed
        it across foaming torrents, and at last on a lofty barren table-land,
        he appeared to be fast approaching it. But the lion, roaring terribly,
        suddenly rushed away, and in the distance he could see it like an
        insect on the grass. Bravely and persistently he followed, however,
        and at last saw that the lion was standing on the edge of a precipice,
        or rather precipitous incline, at the base of which was a deep black
        lake; and it seemed to be in doubt whether to turn and try and rend
        its pur<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>suer, or to yield to fear and rush blindly over the abyss. On
        Philetos rushed, with spear ready to his hand, and he was now within a
        few yards of the beast, when suddenly it sprang down the mountain-side,
        as if panic-struck. In its course it loosened immense rocks, which
        formed an avalanche, following close on its track. Philetos, with
        straining eyes and ears expecting the shock of the rocks falling on the
        water, stood at the edge of the abyss. At length the lion fell into the
        lake, and in a moment the terrific splash of the avalanche was heard.
        Then Philetos awoke, and springing up from his couch, stood up, with
        the noise still roaring in his ears. But on awakening he had entirely
        forgotten the lion, and he thought that he had surely heard the fall
        of immense rocks into water. He looked on the sunlight that streamed
        through his chamber windows, and tried to shake off his terror; for
        he thought that the Egyptian had broken faith, and that the end of
        humanity was near at hand. Breathlessly he waited to hear if a second
        noise would follow; for he knew that now, at least, he was fully awake,
        and that if he should again hear what he had heard, or dreamed he had
        heard, his fears would be realised. Nothing seemed to break the silence
        but the sighing of a gentle wind in the sombre<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span> trees, and the cries
        of animals in the distant forests; yet still he stood breathless, and
        scarcely able to stand with excitement. Never in his life before had he
        been thus moved: in a multitude of perils by land and sea, his cheek
        had not blanched; without fear he had fought alone with beasts in the
        midst of the forest, with only the moonlight to direct his blows;
        without fear he had found himself in the pathless desert deprived of
        food or water; and without fear he had attended to the wants of men
        struck with the plague. Never before had he feared for his life; but
        now he thought that all his fellows&mdash;men who, even at first sight, had
        loved him, and showered on him gifts and favours; whom he had loved
        as much in return; amongst whom he had no enemies, save the Egyptian
        priest; and by whom he had been worshipped almost as a god, save by
        him,&mdash;he thought that humanity was now to feel the revenge of that
        terrible intellect, and man, woman, and child in a few hours or days to
        lie writhing in mortal anguish, or withering under the breath of the
        plague. And this it was that filled him with terror. Not now did he
        seem like Apollo, clothed with immortal strength and beauty, but rather
        like Niobe, expecting her offspring to be struck down by the darts of
        the far-shooter.
    </p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span></p>

    <p>
        Suddenly the noise which he had heard in his dreams was repeated;
        now there could be no doubt. He heard distinctly the masses of stone
        striking the waters, and the rush of the waters over them. He knew
        for a certainty that the barrier of the temple, which was to fall and
        give access to the light of the sun only on the day when mankind was
        doomed to be exterminated, had fallen. What his dream had pictured
        as the plunge of the lion, had been the fall of the outer barrier;
        and now he had heard the innermost wall&mdash;the dreadful veil, the fall
        of which was to reveal the most terrible spectacle ever enacted on
        this earth&mdash;fall irrevocably into the poisonous lake. In a moment, he
        thought, the awful ceremony will commence: even now the dead are raised
        and eagerly expecting the consummation of their hatred; the music is
        breathing out the solemn, gentle strains, that will soon swell into
        maddening peals, and rouse the fury of the haters of men from its
        slumber of ten thousand years. It is no longer a thought: he can hear
        the weird sounds, which welcome the dead to life, and form a fitting
        prelude to the awful catastrophe. What can he do? Even now, though
        the Egyptian should have his hand on the key of the gates of death,
        Philetos imagines that could he see him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span> face to face, he would forego
        his revenge, and dare to disobey and dishonour his ancestors. He is
        certain that this is the work of the priest, and still believes the
        Egyptian to be his friend. There is one chance still: if he can gain
        access to the temple he will plead the cause of men, and perchance save
        them. He rushes from his chamber, and nothing hinders his advance down
        the dreary corridor that leads to the temple gate. Fleeter than the
        deer he passes along; the roof re-echoes the tread of his feet, and the
        hollow clang seems like the shriek of despair; the fitful light of the
        few flickering lamps is pallid and ghastly, and seems to fall with the
        greatest intensity on the bas-reliefs, which he knows represent the
        final sufferings of man. The thick humid air seems to fan him like a
        wind, so fleetly does he run. In so brief a space has he accomplished
        the entire length, that hardly could the priest have turned to bar
        the gate of the temple, even if he had been aware of the object of
        Philetos. But so engrossed were both he and the Egyptian, that they
        heard not the advancing steps, and he passed the door, and was already
        advancing along the central aisle, before he was perceived. On opening
        the massive gate, a spectacle so terrible met his gaze, that nothing
        but the lofty purpose with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span> which he was animated could give him
        strength and courage to pass through the temple.
    </p>

    <p>
        Only once before had he passed through the massive entrance, and
        then a single lamp, carried in the hand, had afforded him glimpses
        only of the architecture of the place, where the Egyptians, wrapt in
        their everlasting robes, were waiting for the time when it should
        be permitted them to link together again the broken chain of life,
        and end their existence with a moment of delirious joy&mdash;of joy so
        intense as to compensate for all their life-long toil, and a voluntary
        entombment of a thousand years. Even then, when a thousandth part was
        not revealed to him, what he had seen had caused him to tremble. The
        pillars by which the roof was supported seemed of adamantine strength;
        but this was relieved by no graceful capital, nor was the surface
        smooth and polished. On the contrary, deeply engraven on the stone were
        unintelligible signs, and exact images of the loathliest animals and
        most noxious plants.
    </p>

    <p>
        There were sculptured groups in abundance; but hate and destruction in
        their most horrible garbs formed the only theme. Here was a serpent
        enveloping a deer in its scaly folds; the deer had been designed with
        the most graceful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span> form, but the marble of which it was carved seemed
        shivering with horror. There, again, was a man of unshapely form, but
        evidently of immense strength, with a brow that denoted the highest
        intelligence, and features that expressed the intensest cruelty,
        strangling a being of the most perfect stature and beauty. There were
        pictures, too, and in one of these, at first glance, he had missed the
        prevailing emotion. A number of maidens were bathing, as careless,
        unconscious, and graceful as water-lilies hardly moved by the breeze;
        but when he looked again he saw beneath the water a monster that seemed
        half alligator, half serpent, and yet altogether human.
    </p>

    <p>
        These glimpses had filled him with horror on his first visit, but now
        the light of an African sun fully revealed the minutest details. The
        pillars with their engraven loathliness, the paintings and sculptures
        almost innumerable, seemed as if they had been suddenly endowed
        with life by the heat and glare of the sun. But they formed only an
        appropriate setting to the rest of the picture.
    </p>

    <p>
        The robes which had hitherto completely covered the bodies of the
        Egyptians, had now fallen to their feet, and they were standing in
        the garb of life. Not even a face-cloth obscured<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span> their visages. They
        seemed as if they had just been struck dead in the performance of some
        religious ceremony; but, in reality, the reverse had taken place. A
        closer examination would have shown that they were just aroused from
        their sleep, for their eyes were open; and though they moved neither
        hand nor foot, nor seemed to draw breath, the look of the eyes seemed
        not altogether as of the dead. There they stood in close array, all
        in the same attitude, steadfastly gazing at the upper part of the
        temple&mdash;seeming only to wait for some signal to open their mouths
        and speak, and rush tumultuously towards the day&mdash;where, arrayed in
        gorgeous robes, stood the friend of Philetos, bearing in his hand
        two keys&mdash;the keys<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> of life and death; they seemed as if gazing on
        the sky, in expectation of the signal of life, on which they would
        open their mouth and speak, and rush tumultuously forward. But as men
        looking to the gods for aught receive what they desire, or in some sort
        what they desire, at the hands of men, so the entry of Philetos seemed
        to loosen their frozen bodies as the expected signal from <span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>heaven.
        Yet they moved not, for the newly given life was snatched away by a
        dreadful apprehension. But as he passed through their midst, a thousand
        eyes darted on him looks of fear, hatred, and surprise. In a moment,
        too, voices faint and low, as voices in a deep cave hardly heard by the
        persons above, assailed him on all sides; fierce and vehement words
        reached him, but they seemed as large stones hurled from too great a
        distance, which gently roll up to the feet of him they were intended
        to crush. He heeded them not, even heard them not distinctly, but with
        rapid steps advanced to his friend.
    </p>

            chapter. The plagues were supposed to be locked up like the winds
            in the cave of Æolus, and by turning the key of death they would be
            blown about the world, whilst by turning the key of life they would be
            rendered harmless.

    <p>
        The priest, who at first had seemed thunderstruck, and too much
        astonished to say or do aught, now poising his javelin, hurled it at
        Philetos with a fierce curse. But wrath or fear misdirected the aim,
        and the javelin struck the sculpture of the wrestlers, and broke off
        the hand of the ideal of intellect and cruelty. The Egyptian himself
        seemed a prey to the most violent agitation; at one time he looked
        to his ancestors, and at another to Philetos, seeming in doubt which
        to obey. Yet he drew not his sword, nor made any effort to kill his
        friend, as in similar circumstances he had done before. On his visage,
        usually, even in the most perilous and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span> exciting circumstances, as
        cold and immovable as marble, was depicted a most terrible struggle
        of emotion. On the one hand, the friendship for which he had already
        sacrificed so much, and which year by year had been growing in
        intensity, urged him in one direction; but on the other, the purpose
        of his life, and the lives of his ancestors&mdash;the tremendous weight
        that accrued to this purpose by the already accomplished resurrection,
        the vividness with which he saw his hereditary object before him, and
        in addition his sombre religion, which had never ceased to have the
        greatest sway over him&mdash;urged him to kill Philetos. At length, as
        men driven this way and that by doubts at last appeal to chance, and
        then become firm in one resolution by the upshot of a most trivial
        event, so the Egyptian, when he saw the priest raise his javelin, did
        not attempt to hinder him, but seemed to decide to act according to
        the javelin;&mdash;if it struck Philetos ever so slightly, to slay him at
        once&mdash;and if it failed, to renounce his ancestors. Accordingly, when
        not only did it not strike Philetos, but ominously released the fair
        statue from the grasp of its destroyer, he grasped Philetos by the
        hand, but remained silent through emotion. But the priest, whom this
        act seemed to render furious, thinking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span> that the fate of the world and
        his revered masters depended on him alone, drew his sword and rushed
        at Philetos. But he, for the first time in his life enraged with a
        fellow-man, avoiding the blow, caught the priest and hurled him into
        the lake. Still the Egyptian spoke not, nor raised a hand against him.
        Then arose a faint cry, yet a cry which seemed in its purpose naturally
        strong enough to have shaken the temple to the ground, from the
        multitude who filled the temple. Yet they moved not, but with all their
        efforts could only look their hatred, and mutter faintly. Then followed
        a deep silence, for Philetos, after slaying the priest, seemed struck
        with deep sorrow, for never before had he slain a man. At length the
        father of all these haters of men, in a tremulous voice, thus spoke,
        and as he spoke, not one of his descendants, nor Philetos, moved ever
        so slightly, but in the deepest silence all gave heed to him:&mdash;
    </p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span></p>

    <p>
        “Verily thou art born in my image, and I should think thee my own
        son, but that a multitudinous murmuring, which only hundreds of my
        descendants could have uttered, has cursed thee, as I curse thee now.
        Think not that I, who have waited for my vengeance these thousands of
        years, will now stoop to entreat thee, puny weakling, to do what do
        thou must; for I command thee on the instant to slay this man, and
        unlock the gates of death. Thinkest thou because I am feeble and but
        half aroused from this deathly sleep, that therefore thou canst with
        impunity mock me thus? Nay, rather, but that Will which has kept me
        fixed in my resolve, and has made these hundreds keep most strictly
        all my laws, that Will, though now it be manifested by a feeble voice,
        cannot fail to force thy sickly nature as it listeth. By the wrongs I
        suffered from the foolish race of men, who would none of my counsel,
        though to every tribe I offered life and peace; by the blood which
        flows in thy veins, by the mighty ties of nature, by the oath I and
        these have sworn, I charge thee to do my bidding; tarry an instant
        and I curse thee with the fatal curse. Darest thou look on me, and
        these thy forefathers, and still let doubt divide thy mind? I charge
        thee, pour out on the world the measure of my hate; unlock these
        fatal gates, and, unworthy as thou art, look no longer on us, but
        cast thyself headlong, having fulfilled thine oath. My voice already
        fails&mdash;slay&mdash;slay&mdash;slay!”
    </p>

    <p>
        Thus ended the father of the haters of men, and the Egyptian drawing
        his sword, struck fiercely at Philetos; but less violent was the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
        stroke than that with which the grass, bent by a gentle wind, smites
        the earth. He muttered&mdash;
    </p>

    <p>
        “I cannot; thrice before have I thus purposed, and thrice have I
        failed.”
    </p>

    <p>
        Then arose a shriek of horror from those dying men, and the father of
        them all, with a low, feeble, passionate voice, broke forth&mdash;
    </p>

    <p>
        “By the stars of heaven, by the caves of the sea, by mighty nature,
        mother of all things, who once articulately promised me this power over
        one man, I consign thee to unfathomable misery for a thousand thousand
        years. On the instant thou shalt die, and thy spirit herd with the
        loathliest animals. In murky darkness and loathsome air, now sinking
        in mire, with reptiles for thy pillow, now in burning sands alive with
        fiery serpents, thou shalt pass a miserable afterlife; more horrors
        than ever I could devise shall be thy portion. It is spoken! I curse
        thee with the fated curse!”
    </p>

    <p>And from the lips of those dying men arose the cry of “We curse thee!”</p>

    <p>
        They spoke no more, but with tottering steps advanced towards the two
        who were still in the flush of life. Then murmured the Egyptian&mdash;
    </p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span></p>

    <p>
        “Philetos, thou seest what I have done for thee; and now I cannot have
        my reward in simply clasping thy hand, for then thou must share my
        fate.”
    </p>

    <p>
        But Philetos, turning his back on the advancing hosts, clasped his
        friend by the hand, and in a ringing voice said&mdash;
    </p>

    <p>
        “Shake off thy terror; look out on the plains beneath; seest thou not
        the sun smiling on the forests?&mdash;hearest thou not the cries of the wild
        animals? Let us away and hunt, and forget this horror; see, all nature
        smiles, and mocks at the curse.”
    </p>

    <p>But that other answered in a melancholy voice&mdash;</p>

    <p>
        “Compared with mine, thy sight is dim, and thine ears are dull;
        but seest thou not that black cloud arising?&mdash;hearest thou not the
        gathering storm?”
    </p>

    <p>
        But Philetos answered&mdash;“Truly there is a cloud, but we shall hunt the
        more pleasantly; and what is rain in its season?”
    </p>

    <p>
        “Speak no more,” answered his friend; “but if thou canst not read the
        meaning of the storm, look over the abyss and tell me what thou seest
        in the poisonous lake.”
    </p>

    <p>Philetos darted to the edge of the abyss and recoiled in horror.</p>

    <p>
        “I see,” he said,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span> “a huge monster with gaping jaws, rearing his snaky
        folds out from the mire; and its eyes are like the eyes of men that
        hate, and it hisses death and misery. Let us flee&mdash;let us flee!”
    </p>

        “Alas!” replied the Egyptian, “thou hast clasped my hand, and thou too
        must die, and suffer torment with me; say thou dost not hate me&mdash;say
        thou wilt not curse me when we two shall be deep in horror.”
    </p>

    <p>
        Philetos looked once more on the monster, which had now reared its
        slimy head above the precipice, and he read his doom in its vengeful
        eyes. But he quailed not, but pressing the hand of his friend, cried&mdash;
    </p>

    <p>
        “Fear not thou! What if we must be in torment for a thousand thousand
        years, shall we not ever after receive homage from thousands of men
        whom we have saved from death?&mdash;will not the shades after these few
        years pay us homage?&mdash;and shall we not again and for ever hunt together
        and live life in life?”
    </p>

    <p>
        Then murmured the Egyptian&mdash;“If I am ever with thee, even such misery
        were bliss; yet let us not die by this loathsome monster.”
    </p>

    <p>
        So saying, he clasped Philetos, and turned the key of the gate of life!
        Then with a shout of triumph they hurled themselves into the abyss,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
        and were lost in the depth of the poisonous lake.
    </p>

    <p>
        Then arose a mighty storm, and the day was changed to night, and the
        temple rocked to its foundations. The haters of men fell to the earth,
        and with deep curses gasped out their breath. And the storm increased,
        and the earth trembled, till, with a shriek of despair, all the
        structure was buried beneath the waters.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
